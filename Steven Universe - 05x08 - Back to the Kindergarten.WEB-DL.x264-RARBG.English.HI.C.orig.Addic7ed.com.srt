Ooh. Hey there, girl.

00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:36,530
Yo, Steven!
This a bad time?

6
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:39,066
Of the three things I have to do
in the sink now,

7
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:41,202
this is the one
I least mind you seeing.

8
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:44,906
Ugh, Peridot is still depressed
all up in your B-room?

9
00:00:44,908 --> 00:00:47,742
Yeah. She still hasn't
gotten over Lapis leaving

10
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:49,510
and taking the barn
with her into space.

11
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:52,346
I think she just needs
a little more time to herself.

12
00:00:52,348 --> 00:00:54,949
Nope, that's it,
we're getting her out.

13
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:56,717
Wait, Amethyst!

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,333
Uh, Peridot?
[Country music playing]

00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:20,675

Nothing.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,148
You've been in this bathroom
kind of a long time.

24
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,216
Maybe you should
get some fresh air.

25
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:32,353
What's the point?

26
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:35,923
- To feel better?
- Come on, Peridot!

27
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:38,526
I can't stand seeing you
like this.

28
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:43,397
- Like what?
- Dude, let's just get out of the house.

29
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,866
We could go check out
my old kindergarten!

30
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:48,336
We met all those other Amethysts
up in space,

31
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:50,605
and they all came out of
the same rock as me.

32
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:52,907
I've been meaning to get a look
at the old neighborhood

33
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:54,442
now that I've met the neighbors.

34
00:01:54,444 --> 00:01:56,911
That sounds fun.
What do you say, Peridot?

35
00:01:56,913 --> 00:01:58,279
you can make us feel dumb

36
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:00,581
by telling us all the stuff
we don't know!

37
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,417
I miss that.

38
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:07,154
Great, it's settled!
Let's get out of the bathroom.

39
00:02:07,156 --> 00:02:11,759

- No.

Why exactly are we taking

42
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,568
this outdated, clackity ship there?

43
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,071
The prime kindergarten has
a very convenient warp pad.

44
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:26,240
Eh, we're taking
the scenic route!

45
00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:29,610
Come on, Peridot! Take a look
at the beautiful countryside.

46
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:31,078
No.

47
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,481
Your efforts to entrance me
with Earth's beauty

48
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:34,482
are pointless.

49
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:37,285
My sector of countryside
was perfect.

50
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:39,186
Now it's somewhere in space.

51
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:42,590
Just let me know
when we get there.

52
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:47,361
Good ol' kindergarten!
Just the way I left it!

53
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:49,363
Aw,
some things never change!

54
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:53,200
Gah, actually,
everything's different now!

55
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:56,804
Man, I-I used to think this
place was full of empty holes,

56
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:58,239
but now it's like

57
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:02,109
it's empty with holes
which were once full!

58
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:04,579
All those Amethysts
I met in space ...

59
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:05,880
they were all here!

60
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:07,548
While I was right there
in the ground.

61
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,918
But now I can finally start
putting some faces to holes!

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,587
Hohohoh, let's see...

63
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:13,754
Hup!

64
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,856
This must've been 8XJ!

65
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:17,258
Ooh!

66
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,559

Peridot: Actually, the order
goes from top to bottom.

69
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:26,133
- That's 8XJ.
- Really?

70
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:28,636
Yes. Curly hair, right?

71
00:03:28,638 --> 00:03:30,471
Yeah! How'd you know?

72
00:03:30,473 --> 00:03:33,741
You can tell from the iron
deposits in the formation there.

73
00:03:33,743 --> 00:03:36,210
And that's 8XL down below.

74
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,848
Whoa, that's pretty amazing, Dot.

75
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:45,186
This used to make sense to me.

76
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:48,222
I thought life was generated
in a kindergarten.

77
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:52,627
Formless, aimless energy
channeled into new, useful gems.

78
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:57,598
But life doesn't start in a
kindergarten. It ends here.

79
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,134
I've gotten used to
plants everywhere.

80
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:02,970
Bugs and breeze and sunshine...

81
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:05,740
all of that has been
sucked out of this place.

82
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:07,775
It's with the Amethysts
that were produced here,

83
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:11,345
and now this place is
nothing but a miserable husk.

84
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:13,514
All of the Amethysts are gone.

85
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:14,682
Hey!

86
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:17,685
Oh, all the well-made
Amethysts are gone.

87
00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:19,220
Yo, not better.

88
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:21,555
And nothing will ever
grow here again,

89
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:24,325
not even this flower.

90
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:26,727
Wait!

91
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:27,895
Oh!

92
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:29,897
I've never seen anything
growing here,

93
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:33,868
and I've been hanging around
this joint for 5,000 years.

94
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,837
Man,
it looks healthy, too.

95
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,006
Wow!
That's Earth for you ...

- always bouncing back.
- I don't know.

97
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:43,110
I'd have to run some tests

98
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,079
to see if this is not an anomaly.

99
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:48,249
You want to try planting stuff here?
You know how to farm!

100
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:50,117
Yeah, that could be fun!

101
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:53,220
It could be
an interesting experiment.

102
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:56,757

...several tutorials I read,

110
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:28,783
the roots should be
starting to take hold.

Oh, yeah?

112
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:33,754
So that's something we can check
for today, as soon as ... Steven!

they grew much overnight?

Yeah, I bet the place
looks even better!

119
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:49,637
We should plant
even more stuff.

What do you think
we should do next?

121
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:55,810
- What about hydrangeas?
- Uh, which one's that?

122
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:58,579
I don't know,
but it sounds good, right?

123
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:00,748
What do you think, Peridot?

124
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,151
Hey, thanks for doing this with me.

00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:07,622
- What? [Chuckles] Come on.
- It was fun.

I'm just glad
I was able to fix something.

better than ever!

Well, I don't know
why I'm surprised.

I should've known
not to have hope.

131
00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:36,851
But maybe if we try again...

132
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:38,486
It's not going to work!

that nothing's ever
going to get better!

Everything is just
ruined forever!

We can't get
any of it back!

And not this crummy planet,
either!

00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,375
We might as well just
throw it all in the garbage

144
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:02,977
and toss ourselves in after,

145
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:05,413
because it's
all just hopeless trash!

didn't work,

Man, you were right.

The kindergarten really is
dead forever.

167
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:26,060
I was a fool to think we could
reinstitute life there.

[Sighs]
Tell me about it.

169
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:30,531
All right. I will.

170
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,667
I was pretty much using this
as a distraction

171
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:34,902
from losing Lapis,
losing the barn,

172
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:37,038
and just a general sense of
complete hopelessness

173
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,440
I tend to deal with
on a day-to-day basis.

174
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:41,542
But it really only
confirmed for me

175
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:43,844
that once you mess something up,
it's ruined for good

176
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:47,014
and nothing will ever
be able to grow again.

177
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:49,750
Yeah, we got the subtext.

00:09:51,386 --> 00:09:53,254
Oh, wow.

179
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:55,389
What about all this?

180
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:58,159
Now that's some plants.

181
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,660
Huh.

182
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:02,863
Guess the countryside out here
is pretty beautiful.

183
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:06,267
But who cares? I wanted to
have this for the kindergarten!

184
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:09,637
Even if there was nothing we can
do for that one patch of land,

185
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,807
there's still a whole Earth
blooming all around us.

186
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:14,575
Yeah!

187
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:18,112
Why don't we try gardening
in literally any other place?

188
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:21,048
It'll be easier than trying to
plant in the kindergarten.

189
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,185
That dirt doesn't care
how green your thumb is.

190
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:27,455
Green thumb!
'Cause you're green. [Laughs]

191
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:31,158
- I know that!
- So, are ya in?

192
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,629
- Um...
- Do it, do it, do it, say yes!

193
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:39,267
Ugh. Fine. I've got literally
nothing else to do.

194
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,435
- Oh, yeah!
- Yay!

195
00:10:41,437 --> 00:10:44,672
[Music]
