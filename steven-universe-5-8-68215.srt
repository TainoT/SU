10
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:55,735
Ooh. Hey there, girl.

11
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:57,970
Yo, Steven!
This a bad time?

12
00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:00,506
Of the three things I have to do
in the sink now,

13
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:02,642
this is the one
I least mind you seeing.

14
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:06,346
Ugh, Peridot is still depressed
all up in your B-room?

15
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:09,182
Yeah. She still hasn't
gotten over Lapis leaving

16
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:10,950
and taking the barn
with her into space.

17
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:13,786
I think she just needs
a little more time to herself.

18
00:01:13,788 --> 00:01:16,389
Nope, that's it,
we're getting her out.

19
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:18,157
Wait, Amethyst!

20
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,773
Uh, Peridot?

21
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,868
You... feeling any better?

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,471
Uugghhh.

23
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:37,210
So, what have you been up to?

24
00:01:39,314 --> 00:01:42,115
I, uh, couldn't really
hear you there.

25
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:45,918
Nothing.

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,588
You've been in this bathroom
kind of a long time.

27
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,656
Maybe you should
get some fresh air.

28
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:53,793
What's the point?

29
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:57,363
- To feel better?
- Come on, Peridot!

30
00:01:57,365 --> 00:01:59,966
I can't stand seeing you
like this.

31
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:04,837
- Like what?
- Dude, let's just get out of the house.

32
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:07,306
We could go check out
my old kindergarten!

33
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:09,776
We met all those other Amethysts
up in space,

34
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:12,045
and they all came out of
the same rock as me.

35
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:14,347
I've been meaning to get a look
at the old neighborhood

36
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:15,882
now that I've met the neighbors.

37
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:18,351
That sounds fun.
What do you say, Peridot?

38
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:19,719
you can make us feel dumb

39
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:22,021
by telling us all the stuff
we don't know!

40
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:24,857
I miss that.

41
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:28,594
Great, it's settled!
Let's get out of the bathroom.

42
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:33,199
- Can I bring my music?
- No.

43
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:39,605
Ugh.
Why exactly are we taking

44
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:42,008
this outdated, clackity ship there?

45
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,511
The prime kindergarten has
a very convenient warp pad.

46
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,680
Eh, we're taking
the scenic route!

47
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:51,050
Come on, Peridot! Take a look
at the beautiful countryside.

48
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:52,518
No.

49
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,921
Your efforts to entrance me
with Earth's beauty

50
00:02:54,923 --> 00:02:55,922
are pointless.

51
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:58,725
My sector of countryside
was perfect.

52
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:00,626
Now it's somewhere in space.

53
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:04,030
Just let me know
when we get there.

54
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:08,801
Good ol' kindergarten!
Just the way I left it!

55
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:10,803
Aw,
some things never change!

56
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:14,640
Gah, actually,
everything's different now!

57
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:18,244
Man, I-I used to think this
place was full of empty holes,

58
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:19,679
but now it's like

59
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:23,549
it's empty with holes
which were once full!

60
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:26,019
All those Amethysts
I met in space ...

61
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,320
they were all here!

62
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:28,988
While I was right there
in the ground.

63
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,358
But now I can finally start
putting some faces to holes!

64
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,027
Hohohoh, let's see...

65
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:35,194
Hup!

66
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:37,296
This must've been 8XJ!

67
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:38,698
Ooh!

68
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,999
8XK!

69
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:41,401
8XL!

70
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:44,404
Actually, the order
goes from top to bottom.

71
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:47,573
- That's 8XJ.
- Really?

72
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:50,076
Yes. Curly hair, right?

73
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:51,911
Yeah! How'd you know?

74
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:55,181
You can tell from the iron
deposits in the formation there.

75
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:57,650
And that's 8XL down below.

76
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,288
Whoa, that's pretty amazing, Dot.

77
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:06,626
This used to make sense to me.

78
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:09,662
I thought life was generated
in a kindergarten.

79
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:14,067
Formless, aimless energy
channeled into new, useful gems.

80
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,038
But life doesn't start in a
kindergarten. It ends here.

81
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,574
I've gotten used to
plants everywhere.

82
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:24,410
Bugs and breeze and sunshine...

83
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:27,180
all of that has been
sucked out of this place.

84
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:29,215
It's with the Amethysts
that were produced here,

85
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:32,785
and now this place is
nothing but a miserable husk.

86
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,954
All of the Amethysts
are gone.

87
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:36,122
Hey!

88
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:39,125
Oh, all the well-made Amethysts
are gone.

89
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:40,660
Yo, not better.

90
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:42,995
And nothing will ever
grow here again,

91
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:45,765
not even this flower.

92
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,167
Wait!

93
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:49,335
Oh!

94
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:51,337
I've never seen anything
growing here,

95
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:55,308
and I've been hanging around
this joint for 5,000 years.

96
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,277
Man,
it looks healthy, too.

97
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,446
Wow!
That's Earth for you ...

98
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:03,149
- always bouncing back.
- I don't know.

99
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:04,550
I'd have to run some tests

100
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:06,519
to see if this is not an anomaly.

101
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:09,689
You want to try planting stuff here?
You know how to farm!

102
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:11,557
Yeah, that could be fun!

103
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:14,660
It could be an interesting experiment.

104
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:18,197
Yeah! Let's re-garden
the kindergarten!

105
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:45,451
They don't need
any more water after yesterday,

106
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:46,586
- but according to...
- Ahh.

107
00:06:46,588 --> 00:06:47,987
...several tutorials I read,

108
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:50,223
the roots should be
starting to take hold.

109
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:51,557
Oh, yeah?

110
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:55,194
So that's something we can check
for today, as soon as ... Steven!

111
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:57,497
What are you doing
in that bathing gown?!

112
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,198
Get dressed already!

113
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Oh, uh, right.

114
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:06,672
Do you think
they grew much overnight?

115
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:09,409
Yeah, I bet the place
looks even better!

116
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,077
We should plant
even more stuff.

117
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,745
What do you think
we should do next?

118
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:17,250
- What about hydrangeas?
- Uh, which one's that?

119
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:20,019
I don't know,
but it sounds good, right?

120
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:22,188
What do you think, Peridot?

121
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,591
Hey, thanks for doing this with me.

122
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:29,062
- What? Come on.
- It was fun.

123
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:31,931
I'm just glad
I was able to fix something.

124
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:35,802
Yeah, the kindergarten looks
better than ever!

125
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,119
Well, I don't know
why I'm surprised.

126
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:55,922
I should've known
not to have hope.

127
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:58,291
But maybe if we try again...

128
00:07:58,293 --> 00:07:59,926
It's not going to work!

129
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:02,195
It's never going to work, okay?!

130
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:03,930
Hey, don't be a jerk!

131
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,832
We were just trying to
cheer you up.

132
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,867
And good job with that!

133
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,702
I feel just great
now that I know

134
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:12,105
that nothing's ever
going to get better!

135
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:14,407
Everything is just
ruined forever!

136
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:16,309
We can't get
any of it back!

137
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:18,644
Not my home! Not Lapis!

138
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:20,646
And not this crummy planet,
either!

139
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:22,815
We might as well just
throw it all in the garbage

140
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:24,417
and toss ourselves in after,

141
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,853
because it's
all just hopeless trash!

142
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:29,255
Peridot, maybe the sunflowers
didn't work,

143
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:31,891
but we know
something can grow here.

144
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,961
This clod's just like us!

145
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:37,130
Too dumb
to get with the program!

146
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:42,735
Uhhh.

147
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:44,704
- Uh?
- Waaaa!

148
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:53,746
Oh, of course!

149
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:56,416
Peridot!

150
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:04,657
Whoa!

151
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:11,631
- Want to get this together?
- Let's do it!

152
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:36,189
I need to
go to the bathroom.

153
00:09:39,393 --> 00:09:41,027
Man, you were right.

154
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,363
The kindergarten really is
dead forever.

155
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:47,500
I was a fool to think we could
reinstitute life there.

156
00:09:47,502 --> 00:09:50,203
Tell me about it.

157
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:51,971
All right. I will.

158
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:54,107
I was pretty much using this
as a distraction

159
00:09:54,109 --> 00:09:56,342
from losing Lapis,
losing the barn,

160
00:09:56,344 --> 00:09:58,478
and just a general sense of
complete hopelessness

161
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,880
I tend to deal with
on a day-to-day basis.

162
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:02,982
But it really only
confirmed for me

163
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:05,284
that once you mess something up,
it's ruined for good

164
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:08,454
and nothing will ever
be able to grow again.

165
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:11,190
Yeah, we got the subtext.

166
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:14,694
Oh, wow.

167
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:16,829
What about all this?

168
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:19,599
Now that's some plants.

169
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:21,100
Huh.

170
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:24,303
Guess the countryside out here
is pretty beautiful.

171
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:27,707
But who cares? I wanted to
have this for the kindergarten!

172
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,077
Even if there was nothing we can
do for that one patch of land,

173
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:34,247
there's still a whole Earth
blooming all around us.

174
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:36,015
Yeah!

175
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:39,552
Why don't we try gardening
in literally any other place?

176
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:42,488
It'll be easier than trying to
plant in the kindergarten.

177
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,625
That dirt doesn't care
how green your thumb is.

178
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:48,895
Green thumb!
'Cause you're green.

179
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:52,598
- I know that!
- So, are ya in?

180
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,069
- Um...
- Do it, do it, do it, say yes!

181
00:10:56,071 --> 00:11:00,707
Ugh. Fine. I've got literally
nothing else to do.

182
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,875
- Oh, yeah!
- Yay!
