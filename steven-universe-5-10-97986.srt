10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,811
If you see him,
call me right away.

11
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:34,447
He's my only inter-dimensional
gateway to space,

12
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:36,015
and I love him.

13
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,684
Okay, I think I have
enough fliers left to ...

14
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:45,825
What are you doing
Saturday night?

15
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:50,963
- Hey! Listen! Little kid!
- Beat it, Kevin.

16
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:53,799
I'm throwing a party
at my parents' palatial estate.

17
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:56,836
All the coolest teens
in Delmarva have RSVP'd

18
00:00:56,871 --> 00:01:00,439
except one ...
the only one cooler than I am.

19
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:03,476
Are you talking about me?

20
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:05,444
What? No! Ew!

21
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,148
- I'm talking about Stevonnie.
- W-What?!

22
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:11,117
You can't just ...

23
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:13,352
This is the last thing
I need right now.

24
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:16,389
Look, Stevonnie is better
than me, okay?

25
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:18,324
Better dancer, better driver.

26
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,794
Stevonnie truly does not care
what anyone thinks.

27
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:23,996
That's why they're the coolest.

28
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:26,065
If I can't be the coolest,

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,201
I at least got to be seen
hanging with the coolest.

30
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:32,171
Stevonnie only exists
when Connie and I are together,

31
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:36,075
and we're...
I'm not coming.

32
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,843
Great.

33
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:40,513
So I invited that other kid
for nothing.

34
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:44,250
Wh... Connie's going?!

35
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:45,551
Of course she's going.

36
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:48,587
No one turns down an
invitation to a Kevin party.

37
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:49,989
But she can't stand you.

38
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:51,991
Why would she ...
Wait.

39
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:54,160
Did you say
all of this to her, too?

40
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:55,895
Does she think I'm ...

41
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,563
I'm gonna be there?

42
00:01:57,598 --> 00:02:01,067
- Is it too late to RSVP?
- Yes.

43
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:04,770
But I'll make an exception...
for Stevonnie.

44
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:10,843
Wait. What's your number?
I'll text you the address.

45
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,747
Oh. Yeah, uh, 301-555...

46
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:17,416
Here, you enter it.

47
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:19,452
Okay, uh, how do I...?

48
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:21,554
You roll the little ball to navigate.

49
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:24,924
The screen is so tiny.
Here.

50
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,026
Huh, your name's Steven?

51
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,995
Weird.
I thought it was Clarence.

52
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:33,132
See you at the party Saturday, Steven.

53
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,215
Steven!
What took you so long?!

54
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,250
I-I got lost
coming up the driveway.

55
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:54,887
Yo, Kev, who invited
the 7-year-old, bro?

56
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:56,255
Hey, shut your mouth,
Derrick!

57
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,624
I thought I told you
to go buy more ice!

58
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:02,095
Ugh. You just come from picture
day at school or something?

59
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:04,831
I brought snacks?

60
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,100
Wha...?

61
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:10,336
This party is lame enough
as it is.

62
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:11,637
Look at these people.

63
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,944
This is forgettable.
But not for long.

64
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:21,614
Every time Stevonnie shows up
on the scene,

65
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,115
everybody's
talking about it.

66
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,918
<i>And when Stevonnie shows up
at my party,</i>

67
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:27,953
everyone's gonna be
talking about this night

68
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:30,022
until they're
old grandparents,

69
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:33,759
and their last words
to their grandchildren will be,

70
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:36,829
"Kevin throws the best parties."

71
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:39,298
Um...

72
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,767
Lion?!

73
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:44,303
Wait, you're the one
who had him the whole time?!

74
00:03:44,338 --> 00:03:47,173
What? Ugh!
No, I'm allergic to dogs.

75
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,808
Then what's he doing here?

76
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,185
- Connie!
- Hey!

77
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,453
I haven't seen her in so long.

78
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:04,023
She looks so different.
Ugh!

79
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:05,391
I thought she'd be here
to see me,

80
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:08,294
but maybe she's just here
to have a good time.

81
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:09,695
Maybe she's moved on.

82
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,163
She's moved on?

83
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:12,798
Wait,
did you guys break up?

84
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,833
Can 7-year-olds
even do that?

85
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:16,702
I'm 14.

86
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:18,537
You didn't tell me
you guys broke up.

87
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:20,339
You got a free ticket
to what would have been

88
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:22,875
the best teen party
in Delmarva.

89
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,711
But now it's just
some sad kid party

90
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:28,380
getting crashed
by a couple of sad kids!

91
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:32,017
All right, okay.
I'm ... I'm leaving.

92
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:35,354
No.
When did this happen?

93
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:37,056
A few weeks ago.

94
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:39,525
Hmm.
You been texting her?

95
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,993
Several dozen times.

96
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:43,729
She text you back?

97
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:45,898
Um, no.

98
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:49,268
Hmm, but she knew
you'd be here.

99
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:51,003
Right! Right.

100
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:53,105
I'll ... I'll just go
talk to her.

101
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,373
I'll ...

102
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:56,875
I'll just go tell her
how sorry I am.

103
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,012
I-I really messed up.

104
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:01,947
I-I was an idiot!
And I ...

105
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,783
Whoa! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

106
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,685
Okay, kid, listen.

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,255
I wouldn't normally do this
because you're a pitiful kid

108
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,889
with snot coming out
of your nose...

109
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:14,026
...but I need
those old people

110
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:16,095
to whisper my name
when they die.

111
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,563
And if you don't
pull it together,

112
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:18,864
you're gonna regret it.

113
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:21,267
And it'll be Sabina
all over again!

114
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:24,570
Wh... Who's...
Who's Sabina?

115
00:05:27,174 --> 00:05:29,908
You can't just dump
your emotional honesty face

116
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:32,244
all over her.
You're gonna freak her out.

117
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,781
I-I just want us to talk again.

118
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:38,384
Exactly.
But look what she's doing.

119
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:41,387
Life is good.
She's got a dog now.

120
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:43,422
And a haircut.

121
00:05:43,457 --> 00:05:46,091
Right.
But your life is good, too.

122
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,760
You don't need
to talk to her, either.

123
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:52,131
You've got new stuff going on ...
new friends, new shirt.

124
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,134
She gave this to me
for my birthday.

125
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:56,935
Ugh.

126
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,071
Derrick!
Gimme your jacket.

127
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:01,840
What? No.
Dude!

128
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,642
- Derrick! Give me the ...
- Come on!

129
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:05,177
Here. Put this on.

130
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:07,613
Your friend looks
kind of mad, though.

131
00:06:07,648 --> 00:06:09,481
He's not my friend.

132
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:12,318
Put it on. Collar up.

133
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:16,622
Hmm, not quite
cool enough.

134
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:18,691
I got it.

135
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,259
Nice.

136
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:21,960
It's almost like
you have style.

137
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,296
Why do I need the scarf?
It's not even cold out.

138
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:28,200
When you put on a scarf
like this, it's always cool.

139
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:30,703
Let's show her
what a great time you're having.

140
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:07,005
Hey, kid,
you should say hi to Connie.

141
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,874
So I can tell her
about my feelings?

142
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,743
No. Be casual.

143
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:12,845
You're showing her
how you have it together.

144
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,079
You're not dying
to talk to her

145
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:15,814
because you're not dying
at all.

146
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:17,216
You're living.

147
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:19,551
Make her want
that life with you.

148
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:22,521
Kevin, that ...
that's kind of moving.

149
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:24,022
So move already.

150
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:27,025
Walk over, be cool,
and walk away.

151
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,361
Got it.

152
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:33,899
Okay. Be cool.

153
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:36,168
Be cool, yeah. Be cool.

154
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:38,704
- Hey!
- Hi.

155
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:41,940
Nice weather
you're wearing.

156
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:45,544
- Uh, I got your texts.
- Oh, yeah.

157
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:48,781
I forgot about those
because I've been living.

158
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:50,048
Wha...?

159
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,584
Well,
back to my great life.

160
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:54,052
Uh, chowzers.

161
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:55,888
That was terrible!

162
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:57,222
This is all wrong,
Kevin!

163
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,525
No way.
Look, little man.

164
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,227
Your girl's making her way
back for more.

165
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:05,397
Steven!
What is going on?!

166
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:07,199
I came here
hoping we could talk,

167
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:10,068
but it seems like you only want
to talk to Kevin.

168
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,438
I guess Kevin is your best friend now.

169
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:15,141
- What? No, no, no!
- What? No, no, no!

170
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:20,245
Anyway,
I'm glad you're doing well.

171
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,748
That's all I really wanted to know.

172
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,484
No, no! But ...
But you're my best friend!

173
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,787
Best friend?! What are you kids
even talking about?

174
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:30,222
I thought she was your ex.

175
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:32,591
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?

176
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:34,092
Think, Kevin.

177
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:37,629
How do people treat their friends?

178
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:39,097
Connie!

179
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:41,500
Wait, wait, Connie.
Don't go.

180
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:44,603
Steven, I wasn't trying
to ignore you.

181
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:46,271
I was going to text you back.

182
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:49,508
I-I wrote,
"I can't talk to you right now,"

183
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:51,276
but then I realized if I sent it,

184
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:52,978
that would be talking to you.

185
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:56,348
<i>And it didn't make any sense.
I wasn't making any sense.</i>

186
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:57,983
If we were
going to talk,

187
00:08:58,018 --> 00:08:59,952
I thought it's got to be in person.

188
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:01,520
So I rode Lion to your house,

189
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:03,822
but there was a note that said,
"Gone vacationing,"

190
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:07,259
and then I ran into Kevin
and he said you'd be here,

191
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:10,295
but, uh, maybe this is still too soon.

192
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,965
I-I don't even know
what to say to you.

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,633
I'm angry.

194
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:16,034
I miss you.

195
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:18,804
I feel like
I'm out of my mind.

196
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,005
No, you're not.

197
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,007
I surrendered myself
to Homeworld.

198
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,142
I let them take me away,
maybe forever,

199
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:28,313
and then I came back and I tried
to act like it was no big deal.

200
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:29,615
<i>But it was a big deal.</i>

201
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,116
I couldn't stand
the thought

202
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:32,885
of you being taken away
on that spaceship,

203
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,953
but then I did that to you.

204
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:39,525
I promised you we'd always be
a team, and I let you down.

205
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,059
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:42,528
Jam buds?

207
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:44,830
Jam buds.

208
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,301
It's so good to talk to you.

209
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:50,736
I've been wanting to see you
so bad

210
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:55,507
I accepted a party invitation
from Kevin.

211
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,176
I know. I took his advice.

212
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:04,049
I think he got is heart broken.
I-It's actually really sad.

213
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:06,251
Of course he did.

214
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:10,155
- Hey, nice shirt.
- Nice hair.

215
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,257
Thank you.

216
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:15,994
All right!
Hey, everybody, are you having fun?

217
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,396
<i>Yeah!</i>

218
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:20,165
Liars!
You're all so fake.

219
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,334
You make me sick.
But get ready.

220
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:25,103
I'm gonna introduce you
to somebody so real

221
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:27,272
you'll all feel as sick as me!

222
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:31,009
This party starts now!
Children! Go!

223
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:38,350
It's pretty late.
We should head out.

224
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:40,218
Thanks for all your help, Kevin.

225
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:43,422
What?
You got to do the thing.

226
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:46,758
What did I help you for if
you're not gonna elevate my party?

227
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:49,861
Wha...? Hey!
Don't you walk away from...

228
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,970
Shut up, Derrick!

229
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:01,940
If it helps, Kevin, I think
you threw a very nice party.

230
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:04,042
Mm-hmm.
Good night!

231
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:06,278
No! Wait!

232
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:16,277
