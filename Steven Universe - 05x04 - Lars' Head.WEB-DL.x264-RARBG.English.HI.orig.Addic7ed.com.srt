[Groans]
What the heck just happened?

4
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:15,032
Lars!
You saved us!

5
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,171
You stopped the Robonoids, but ...
but one of them exploded,

6
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:19,536
and ... and you weren't moving,
and I started crying.

[Gasps]

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,042
I brought you back to life!
It was an accident.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,480
I mean, I probably would've
done that on purpose

10
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:27,044
if I had known I could do that,

11
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:31,253
but I didn't really ask
your permission, so I'm sorry.

12
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:33,517
Back to life?

13
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:36,556
So I was... away from life?

14
00:00:36,592 --> 00:00:39,760
Aah!
I'm pink!

15
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:42,725
Ah! I know.
Do you feel okay?

16
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:45,335
I don't really know.

17
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:48,737
- But your body, are you sore?
- No.

18
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:51,833
- Are you tired?
- No.

19
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:53,934
- Do you feel good?
- No.

20
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:56,076
- Do you feel bad?
- No!

21
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:59,412
I guess I just feel
really freaked out.

22
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:02,748
Well, I am, too, so at least
we're on the same page here.

Those shattering Robonoids
are back!

26
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:10,123
Quickly.

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,629
Block the entrance.

28
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:18,596
- Lars, you stay here and rest.
- All right.

29
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:22,704
I predict Lars will change in hue.

30
00:01:22,738 --> 00:01:24,838

[Whirring]

36
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:43,257
They seem
to have overlooked us

37
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:46,422
for the time being.

38
00:01:46,462 --> 00:01:47,992
Quickly,
block the entrance!

39
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,640
As long as I'm here, they're
gonna keep coming after us.

40
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:54,267
It's true.
This was a horrible plan.

41
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:56,633
Should we try to find
a new hiding spot?

42
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:58,672
No, no, no!
If we leave this cavern,

43
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,438
we'll be
completely exposed.

44
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:03,946
But if we stay here,

45
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,919
they'll find us for sure.

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,690
So, we either stay here
and get caught...

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,660
Or we go out there
and get caught.

48
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:17,328
So, wait,
am I a zombie now?

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,330
No.

50
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,801
Well...no!

51
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,500
You can talk,
and zombies can't do that.

52
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:24,832
I must've healed you.

53
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:27,937
I've healed people before,
just never this much.

54
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,540
Just admit it, Steven!
I'm a zombie!

55
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:33,304
Oh, I know.

56
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:36,542
A zombie wouldn't
have a heartbeat.

58
00:02:40,182 --> 00:02:43,112
That's, uh,
pretty slow.

59
00:02:43,152 --> 00:02:45,852
But I think we can rule out
pink zombie.

60
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,188
Thank the stars.

61
00:02:47,223 --> 00:02:48,523
What's a zombie?

62
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:51,857
I can't believe humans
just change color like this.

63
00:02:51,894 --> 00:02:53,354
They don't.

64
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:55,896
Well, I guess if you get
really cold, you turn blue,

65
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:58,871
and if you get really
embarrassed, you turn red.

66
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:00,201
So what does pink mean?

67
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:02,366
Is Lars gonna explode
or something?

68
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:05,035
Maybe then Lars will reform
with a different color.

69
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:09,674
I'm sure whatever color
Lars chooses

70
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,842
will be lovely.

71
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:14,651

is different.

Aah!
What was that?

75
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:24,227
Huh?
It, like, lit up, right?

76
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,560
You saw it, too.

77
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:26,824
Uh, yeah.

78
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:29,222
What did you do?
Do it again.

79
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:32,599
Why is it doing that?

80
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:35,205
Lars, I think I know
what this is.

81
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:38,077
There's something I can try,
but no.

82
00:03:38,107 --> 00:03:40,407
You don't want me
going in your head.

83
00:03:40,443 --> 00:03:43,243
You're going to
possess me again?

84
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,749
No.
It would be more literal.

85
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:48,051
- Then what is it?
- Forget it.

86
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,113
Look, Steven,
I'm not gonna get mad, okay?

87
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:53,913
I trust you.
Just help me out here.

88
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:57,286
If I've got magic hair now,
I want to know.

89
00:03:58,394 --> 00:04:00,224
Everyone stand back.

90
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:05,636
All right,
now just bend down.

91
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:07,068

92
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,932

a slight foot in your head.

I'm okay.

Sorry, Lars.

125
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:08,058
So what happened?
What's in my head?

126
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,690
- Home.
- Wha?

127
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:12,355
Everyone, I've made
an amazing discovery!

128
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:14,764
I just traveled back
to planet Earth

129
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:16,527
by going through
Lars' head!

130
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:19,435
You went back to Earth?
What the heck?

131
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:21,868
Is my head
like a wormhole?

132
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:23,264
No, it's way simpler
than that.

133
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:24,935
You see,
I have a pink pet lion

134
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:27,074
who belonged to my mom
when she was still here,

135
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:29,049
and it turns out
I can go into his mane,

136
00:06:29,078 --> 00:06:30,878
and it transports me
to a magical dimension

137
00:06:30,913 --> 00:06:33,613
where my mom kept a bunch of
artifacts on a hill with a tree,

138
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:35,619
and for some reason,
I can't breathe in there.

139
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:37,751
But anyway,
when I went into Lars' head,

140
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:40,286
I got transported
to the same magical dimension,

141
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:42,782
but it was a new part of it,
but since the two are connected,

142
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:45,295
I could reach the portal
that leads out of Lion's mane,

143
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:46,897
which is back on Earth!

144
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:48,929
Uh...

145
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:50,594
Here,
I brought you some food.

146
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:53,933
Huh? Thanks,
but I-I'll save it for later.

147
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:55,409
But aren't you hungry?

148
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:58,877
Maybe you only eat magical
lizards now like Lion.

149
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:00,437
A-Are you hungry for lizards?

150
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:02,446
No, I do not want
a lizard.

151
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:04,778
But you haven't eaten
in days.

152
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,143
I know.

153
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:09,351
There must be pink magic
in my guts now or something.

154
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:12,953
What is this box?

155
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:15,828
It's juice.
We drink it back on Earth.

156
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:17,288
- What?
- That's impossible.

157
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,926
- There's no way.
- Unh-unh.

158
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:19,901
Steven's back.

159
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:20,958
That can't be.

160
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:22,126
I'm incredulous.

161
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:23,494
Why can't it be?

162
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:27,792
Everyone knows
that the Earth...

163
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:29,966
Was decimated
by the Diamond attack!

164
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:30,965
Sorry.

165
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:32,836
It's not like that.

166
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,135
The Diamonds did attack,

167
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:36,406
but there are still Gems
living on Earth,

168
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:38,275
and the planet's
full of life.

169
00:07:38,313 --> 00:07:40,473
It grew the potatoes
that became these chips

170
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:43,116
and grew the wheat
that eventually became the flour

171
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:44,512
that eventually became the bread

172
00:07:44,553 --> 00:07:46,683
that eventually became
this sandwich!

173
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:48,322
- Sand...
- Wich?

174
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:51,827
But why would Gems
still live there?

175
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,770
Because the Earth is a place
where we can be ourselves.

176
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:57,797
We can live freely without
having to hide who we are.

177
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,833
Live freely?

178
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,867
Without
having to hide?

179
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:06,803
That sounds wonderful.

180
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:08,202
It is.

181
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:10,503
And now that we have this
portal, we can all go there.

182
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:11,646
All?

183
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,020
How am I supposed to go
through my own head?

184
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:17,549
Oh.
Hmm.

[Grunting]

186
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:22,822

187
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:26,028
[Grunting]

188
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,301
[Grunting]

189
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:30,099
Stop!
You're gonna break my elbow!

190
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:34,706
Okay, so that didn't work, but
I'm sure there's another way.

191
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:36,467
No, no, look.
I get it.

192
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:39,305
Everyone just go,
and I'll stay here.

193
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:41,411
There's no other way out.
I'm it.

194
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:43,343
The Earth is way better
than this.

195
00:08:43,378 --> 00:08:45,178
There's no robots
flying around.

196
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:47,674
Just seagulls that fly
in front of the sunset

197
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:48,716
and it's beautiful!

198
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:50,051
Just go, you'll see.

199
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:54,085
I took it for granted,
so don't pass up this chance.

200
00:08:55,924 --> 00:08:58,024
Well, if you insist.

201
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,230
We won't do it.

202
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:05,863
Not if it means
leaving you behind.

203
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:09,411
What?! I'm trying to perform
a beautiful act over here.

204
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:12,408
We know this planet.

205
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:16,781
We've been hiding
in these tunnels for eons.

206
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:21,742
You'll need us
to help you get around.

207
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:28,884
Besides, us off colors
stick together.

208
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:30,384
We'll get to Earth
another way.

209
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:32,255
We'll find
an alternate route.

210
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:34,594
<i>But you've
got to go back.</i>

211
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,230
But it doesn't feel right
to just leave you here.

212
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:39,096
You said yourself
that everyone on this planet

213
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:40,534
is out to get you.

214
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:43,109
You won't be safe
until you're back on Earth.

215
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:44,368
But, Lars ...

216
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:45,636
Don't argue with me!

217
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:48,104
You're always trying
to help me.

218
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:50,103
You brought me
back to life.

219
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:53,775
Just let me be somebody
who deserved it.

220
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:56,446
All right,
I'll tell everyone you're okay.

221
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:59,215
I'll be back.
I can bring whatever you need.

222
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:02,486
- Be careful, okay?
- We will.

223
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,454
We can't leave without Lars!

224
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:07,293
We'll see you on Earth, I hope.

225
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:09,499
No, no, no.
We will!

[Music]

227
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:20,606
Um, if you
could just...

228
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:22,672
Oh, yeah.

229
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:30,747
This is hopeless.
[Gasps]

230
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:33,816
We'll never get that dropship
to fly, and we're losing time!

231
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:35,786
Who knows what they're doing
to Steven.

232
00:10:35,824 --> 00:10:39,494
Hi, Steven.
What are we going to d...

233
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:41,168
I'm back!
