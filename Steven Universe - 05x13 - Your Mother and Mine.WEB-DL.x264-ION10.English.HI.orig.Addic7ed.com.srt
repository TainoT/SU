Space is really big.
Everything is messed up.

13

Our nova thrusters are busted.

14
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,341
And getting home
is taking forever.

15
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,445
Hey, Captain?
Should we be writing this down?

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,713
Uh, yeah!
[Music]

17
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,550
Who wants a party sub?!

18
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,419
What exactly
are we celebrating?

19
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,988
You guys beat Emerald.

20
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,923
And you rescued me and Connie
from the Jungle Moon.

21
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,891
And you have this
super fast ship,

22
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,893
so you'll be back
on Earth in no time.

23
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,396
It's only super fast
when it works!

24
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,965
Captain Lars...

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,767
I've finished...

26
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,869
rerouting...

27
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,572
Power from the gravity engine
to the nova thrusters?

28
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,274
Great! Twins, floor it
on the thrusters!

29
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,110
Right away, Captain.
Yes, Captain.

30
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,283
Aww!    Aww!
Aww!            Aww!

31
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,485
Captain Lars,
don't use the thrusters.

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,253
We're going to lose power!

33
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,422
Thanks, Padparadscha.

34
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,791
Hey, if we're going to be
drifting a while,

35
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,960
there's somebody
I'd like you all to meet.

36
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,095
[Groans]

37
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,330
Are they bigger
than that sandwich?

38
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:41,266
Maybe a few pickles bigger.

39
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,835
Bigger than you?

40
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,103
I mean,
they don't have to be.

41
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,973
Fine. Bring 'em over.

42
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,508
[Shing!]

43
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,209

00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,311
[Whoosh!]

45
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,979
Twins!

46
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,649
Another...Steven?

47
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,352
There's more of you?!

48
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,320
[All gasp]

50
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,823
Her eyes.

51
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:05,858
A fusion?

52
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,927
He's going to bring back
another Steven!

53
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,062
This is Garnet.

54
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,264
She leads the Crystal Gems
back on Earth.

55
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,832
Just look at you all!

56
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,335
You must be Rhodonite ...
a Ruby and a Pearl?

57
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,104
That must have been a story.

58
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,573
I want all the details.

59
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,041
[Chuckles nervously]

60
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,075
Eh.

61
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,644
And you must be
the Rutile Twins.

62
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,712
[Gasps] I've never seen
anyone like you before.

63
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,215
We were...made like this.

64
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,817
Fluorite. Whoa.

65
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,687
You're just, uh, beautiful.

66
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,192
And here's Padparadscha,
an orange Sapphire.

67
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,827
How rare.

68
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,063
I predict you're going to make
everyone uncomfortable.

69
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,368
It's not nice to make fun
of us like that.

70
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,704
Haven't you guys heard
a compliment before?

71
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,006
A what?
What's that?

72
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,043
You know, it's when someone says
something nice about you.

73
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,879
Who would say nice things
about Gems like us?

74
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,082
We're completely inappropriate,
and so are you.

75
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,984
We should all be ashamed.

76
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,453
Aw, Steven.

77
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,855
These Gems feel just like I did
before I met Rose Quartz.

78
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,359
<i>- Both: Rose Quartz?</i>
- Rose... Quartz?

79
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,094
You met Rose Quartz?

80
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,596
And your survived?

81
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,598
You guys know about Rose?

82
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,100
She was the Anit-Gem ...

83
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,336
an organic beast that burst
out of Earth's crust

84
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,072
and vowed to destroy all Gems!

85
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,307
No, no.

86
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,575
She was made from a vein
of hyper-defective quartz.

87
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,078
A malformed quartz
gone haywire.

88
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:37,549
Don't...be...silly.

89
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:42,454
Rose...Quartz...isn't...real.

90
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,123
You have it all wrong.

91
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,124
Rose Quartz?!

92
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,526
Of course that's how
they tell it on Homeworld.

93
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,928
Come on, everyone.

94
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:54,466
Let me tell you the story
of the real Rose Quartz.

95
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,135
It was Era 1.

96
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,770
The Diamonds, unique
in their flawlessness,

97
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,073
sought to expand their
perfection across the galaxy.

98
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,609
And it was for this purpose
that Pink Diamond

99
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:09,948
chose her first colony,
the planet Earth.

100
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,385
On Earth, every Gem was made
to serve Pink Diamond,

101
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,088
each with a role to play
in her world's perfect empire.

102
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:21,092
In comparison to their creator,
their existence was ordinary.

103
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:24,262
They were life-forms
only meant to fit their mold,

104
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,432
and no one had ever dared
to think otherwise ...

105
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:31,469
until there was Rose Quartz.

106
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:35,507
In stature, she was no different
than any other Quartz,

107
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,009
and for a time, she did her best

108
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,110
to carry out
her Diamond's bidding.

109
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,480
[Music]

110
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:46,618
However, she began to take
notice of her strange colony

111
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,288
and the life that existed there.

112
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,759
Curiosity
turned to appreciation.

113
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,330
Appreciation
turned to fondness.

114
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:02,034
And fondness...turned to love.

115
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,771
Soon she was unable
to keep her findings secret,

116
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,940
and she began asking
her fellow Gems

117
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,576
if they knew
of the life on Earth

118
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,211
and what they made of it.

119
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,346
She continued to pry her
fellow kindergartners

120
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,348
with questions so odd

121
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,984
that word of her eventually made
its way to Pink Diamond.

122
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,520
Rose Quartz
was summoned at once.

123
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,656
"Quartz," began Pink Diamond,

124
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,791
"What have you been
saying down there?"

125
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,827
"Why, Diamond," Rose pleaded,

126
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,796
"It has come to my attention
that your colony,

127
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,399
Earth, bears life.

128
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,034
While I know these organic
life-forms serve no purpose,

129
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,537
I ask that we leave this planet
and spare their lives."

130
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,073
Pink Diamond thought
for a moment

131
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:46,711
and then laughed,
a wicked, empty sound.

132
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,546
"You wish to save
these life-forms

133
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,848
at the expense of our own?

134
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,549
Ha! Don't be absurd.

135
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,819
Return to your post, and I will
forget your insolence."

136
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,888
And with that, Rose Quartz
was dragged back

137
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,990
to her kindergarten for duty.

138
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,092
Only Rose could no longer
stand to continue

139
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,261
aiding in the destruction
of Earth.

140
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,096
She had no choice.

141
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,598
She had to fight.

142
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,200
[Twinkle!]

143
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:13,838
[Music]

144
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,575
"Is this what you want ...
to inject, to build?

145
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,046
I've seen the life that exists
for itself, and it lives here.

146
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,283
Will you destroy it,
or will you join it?"

147
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,352
Rose's message
began to resonate,

148
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,054
to Pink Diamond's dismay.

149
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,122
Her colony was falling apart.

150
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:34,692
So, like a coward, she called
for her Diamond allies,

151
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,428
Yellow and Blue, to help.

152
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,097
But Rose also found herself
with allies,

153
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,933
other Gems that were cast out
for being wrong ...

154
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,269
a Pearl who belonged
to no one...

155
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,438
a Bismuth who built
weapons for rebels

156
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,406
instead of towers for tyrants...

157
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:53,077
an entirely new fusion
for not power but for love...

158
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,113
and countless others,
all inspired by Rose

159
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,048
to live for ourselves on Earth.

160
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,750
She was our leader.

161
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,485
And Earth was our precious home.

162
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,221
And those who fought to save it
became known as...

163
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,623
the Crystal Gems!

164
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,859
Unbelievable.

165
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,160
There were Gems like us?

166
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,128
Fighting.

167
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,631
For...their...freedom?

168
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,334
Yes, and we were fearless.

169
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,636
It was an impossible fight,
but we fought anyway.

170
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:22,273
And the more Gems who saw us,
the more who joined.

171
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,643
But Pink Diamond's forces
proved too strong.

172
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:29,147
Rose feared that soon she would
have nothing left to protect.

00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,982
[Music]

174
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,818
Rose Quartz
drew her rebel blade...

[Shing! Crack!]

176
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,788
...and shattered Pink Diamond,

177
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,159
saving the Earth for all time
from her reign of terror.

178
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,495
Wow! That's incredible!
I don't believe it!

179
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,663
Your mom did all that?

180
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,832
That's awesome!

181
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,033
Wait. What about the rest?

182
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,203
What happened after that?

183
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,307
Garnet:
The other Diamonds were furious.

184
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,676
In a last-ditch attempt
to wipe out the rebellion,

185
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,479
the Diamonds launched
a direct attack against Earth,

186
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,949
and in their fury, they used
their powers to end the fighting

187
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,552
once and for all.

188
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,453
[Twinkle! Zap!]

189
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,356
[Music]

190
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,793
I predict this story
won't have a happy ending.

191
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,196
We were all told
different stories.

192
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,498
But they all ended
the same way.

193
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,834
With Rose Quartz...

194
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,570
being...defeated.

195
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,907
This new version of the story
is even worse!

196
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:32,210
So, she was great,
and they beat her?

197
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,779
What are we supposed
to get out of this ...

198
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,247
that we can never win?!

199
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,849
We haven't yet, but we can,

200
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,217
and we will.

201
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,686
They said they annihilated
Rose's rebellion,

202
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,255
but here we are.

203
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,757
They said they annihilated
all of you on Homeworld,

204
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,392
but here you are.

205
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,093
They think they have us
on the run,

206
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,496
but they're the ones that are
running from the truth.

207
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,898
And the truth is

208
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,867
we...are...everywhere!

209
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,503
But how many more of us
can there be?

210
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,972
Way more than you think!

211
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,906
I was only on Homeworld
for, like, an hour

212
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,442
before I ran in to you guys.

213
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,710
There must be Off Colors
all over the place.

214
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,846
Rose used to say there
was something about Earth ...

215
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,949
something that set Gems free.

216
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,750
But it's not just Earth.

217
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,152
Look at you.

218
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,355
Love, freedom ...
it's universal.

219
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,558
You all prove it every moment
you live as yourselves.

220
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,560
You can show everyone.

221
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,730
We...can do that?

222
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,933
Not while we're floating
out here like sitting ducks.

223
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,869
Fluorite, let's take
another look at that engine.

224
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,438
- Yes!
- Okay!

225
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,139
- Yeah!
- Fluorite: Lars.

226
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,275
Before we can activate
the thrusters,

227
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,444
we're going to need
to restart the core.

228
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,946
How do we do that?

229
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,448
We'll figure it out
together.

230
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,550
Hey, uh, Garnet?

231
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,620
When Connie and I were stranded
on the Jungle Moon, I ...

232
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,188
we ... saw something...

233
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,257
a vision...of...
Pink Diamond.

234
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,426
Hmm.

235
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,961
When Blue Diamond
came to Earth,

236
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,962
I had dreams where
I saw through her eyes

237
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,631
and I was crying her tears.

238
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,667
If I'm having the same dreams
about Pink Diamond,

239
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,069
what if that means
she's still out there?

240
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,971
She's gone, Steven.

241
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,607
Your mother
made sure of that.

242
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,142
But I felt such
a strong connection.

243
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:15,179
You have empathetic powers
that other Gems don't have.

244
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:19,083
You're unusual, Steven,
like them and like me.

245
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,918
It's not something to fear.

246
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,921
It's something to celebrate.

247
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,656
Come on, come on.

248
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,892
Oh, strange.

249
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,626
The core should have
come online by now.

250
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:33,297
I predict that Captain Lars will
be pressing the wrong button.

251
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,500
Oh.

252
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,835
Yes! We did it!

253
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,672
[Music]

254
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,674
Does that mean you can
get back to Earth?

255
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,976
Not...quite.

256
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:51,011
The nova thrusters
still need...repairs.

257
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,053
We can hit up the nearest
colony for parts.

258
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,021
Rhodonite, tell me
there's one nearby.

259
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:01,325
Well, we aren't far from one of
Yellow Diamond's asteroid mines.

260
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,662
But that place will be
crawling with Agates, Captain.

261
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,631
It's incredibly dangerous.

262
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,601
So are we.
Let's show 'em!

263
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:13,995
