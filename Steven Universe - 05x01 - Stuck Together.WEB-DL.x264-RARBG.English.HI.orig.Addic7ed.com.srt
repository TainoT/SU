That's right.
You caught me.

Wait till the Diamonds
get their hands on you.

one of the humans anyway.

Don't know what we'll do
with just one of them,

24
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:08,319

for the Diamonds to decide.

Wait.
Aquamarine, the deal is off.

26
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:14,763
You were only supposed
to take me. No humans.

Topaz, what do you think?

35
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,720
Should we let her friend go?

36
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:41,017
I agree.

Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not again.

I'll go let the Diamonds know
about our little prisoner.

so many Gems

into joining
your rebellion?

45
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:04,646

00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,751

this is all your fault.

All this weird alien stuff ...
this is 'cause of you, isn't it?

51
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:26,872
Yes, of course it is!

52
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:29,673
That's why I turned myself in ...
to save all of you!

53
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:32,166
Well, it didn't really work out
too well, did it?

54
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:35,009
Well, everyone else managed
to get off the ship.

55
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:36,335
So, where were you?

56
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,349
I ran and hid, Steven,

57
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:41,451
like any sensible person
would... do

58
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:44,185
if they wanted to get trapped
on a ship.

59
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,351

I did do something.</i>

63
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:55,355
I ran and hid
just like I always do.

64
00:02:55,398 --> 00:02:58,028
Just like I ran
from the potluck.

65
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:00,038
But you were abducted.

66
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,240
That's not your fault.

67
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:04,541
No, I trashed my roll
and ran away.

00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:06,544

69
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:09,376

people eat my food?!

just leave it to me.

You have Rose Quartz!

74
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:19,446
Why bother with him?
He's worthless!

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,089
Thanks a lot, Steven.

76
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:24,494
No! I meant like "worth less",
not "worthless"

77
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:26,228
like... relative to me.

79
00:03:27,497 --> 00:03:29,827

a great seat cushion.

You feeling cozy,
you big banana?

81
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,770
I don't think
she's listening.

82
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:39,065
Can you hear me, you ...
What was it Jamie said?

83
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,679
You dangerous yellow coat?

84
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,781
Of course
she can't hear you, Steven.

85
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:45,953

those big headphones on.

A destaba-what?

99
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:20,547
It's a weapon that disrupts
a Gem's physical form.

00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:22,124
Cool.
Thanks for explaining.

101

to be my arms.

00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:32,163
Lars, pull my pants off.

106
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:33,325
What?!

107
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:35,563
Trust me!
I'm trying to save you.

108
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,329
What if I don't want
to be saved?

109
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:40,297
What if I want to stay trapped
here and fly around space,

110
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:42,467
and why your pants,
you weirdo?!

111
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:44,165
Just do it!

00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:46,579

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,740
Ugh.
There. I did it.

114
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:51,548
Great. Now tie one of the legs
into a lasso.

115
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:53,581
I can't.
They're on the floor.

116
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:55,817
What are they doing
on the floor?!

117
00:04:55,852 --> 00:04:58,852
I don't know, Steven.
What are we doing in space?

118
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:03,058
Lars, pick them up
and then tie them into a lasso.

You can do it.

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,880
Ugh. Fine.

130
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,280
Come on.
Just one more try.

131
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,189
I don't want to try again.

Fine!

134
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:39,694
What is your problem,
Lars?!

135
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:41,459
Why did you do that?!

136
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:44,298
Why do you think I'm capable
of anything?!

137
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:47,804
You think I can do
all this stuff, but I can't!

138
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:49,767
I can't because...

139
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:52,206
I'm a wuss, Steven.

140
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:55,482
I'm just [sniffles] afraid.

141
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:59,052
I've always just been stupid
and afraid.

142
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:03,052
Not like you.
You're always helping people.

143
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:06,216
You're never afraid.
[Sniffles]

144
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:11,258
Lars...
I'm afraid right now.

145
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:16,899
I thought if I turned myself in,
it'd fix everything, but...

146
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:19,133
I don't want to do this,
Lars.

147
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,799
I've been to space before,
but not like this.

148
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,239
They're taking me straight
to their terrible leaders

149
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,505
that want to destroy Earth
and destroy me

150
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:29,244
for something
I never even did.

151
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,579
I just wanted to save everyone,
but I couldn't even do that

152
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:36,446
because, look ...
you're still here.

153
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,016
Steven.

154
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:39,124
I'm sorry.

155
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:42,415
I don't know how I'm gonna
get you out of this.

156
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:44,789
We'll figure it out.

157
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:47,098
We've got like
a billion light-years

158
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,130
till we get there,
right?

159
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:51,125
For the first time ever,

160
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,597
you're gonna look
on the bright side?

161
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:55,766
Y-You don't have
to sugarcoat this,

162
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:58,265
but come on,
you never do that.

163
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:02,138
You're always real with me about
how much everything sucks.

164
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:03,948
Okay. You're right.

165
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,480
This is really, really
messed up, Steven.

166
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:09,477
You know what's even more
messed up?

167
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,389
Even though
you're in huge trouble

168
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,521
and it's all my fault...

169
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:16,456
I'm kind of glad
you're here.

170
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:17,793
I...

171
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:20,527
I don't want to be alone
right now.

Isn't that awful?

173
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,570

00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,603
everything is awful.

00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,250
I could try using my legs,
but it might be weird.

179
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:47,257
[Crying]

180
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,990
That's so, so beautiful.
[Sniffles]

181
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:53,897
Even in the clutches
of certain doom,

182
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,560
you're happy
to have each other.

183
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:57,429
[Gasps]

184
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:58,927
T-T-Topaz.

185
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:02,938
I don't know what Topaz would do
if she didn't have Topaz.

186
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:04,572
I've always wanted
to tell me

187
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,107
how I'm helping me
through this,

188
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:09,752
but there's always someone
between us!

189
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:14,684
They're always sending me
on these miserable missions.

190
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:17,087
I'm always pretending
I'm fine with it.

191
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,050
[Sniffles]
I have to pretend I'm fine.

192
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:25,389
But you two ...
you're so honest and open...

193
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:27,928
so [sniffles]

194
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:29,604
I want to help you guys.

195
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:30,772
What do you need?

196
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,530
A way off this ship.

197
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:34,369
And my pants.

198
00:08:34,404 --> 00:08:36,944
All right.
You can use this escape pod.

199
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:40,043
I'll set the coordinates
for Earth.

200
00:08:40,076 --> 00:08:43,276
All right, Lars, just get in
and let it do its thing.

201
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:46,713
Guh. What are you talking about?
You're coming, right?

202
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:48,719
I can't.
I turned myself in.

203
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:50,051
I still got to go.

204
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:52,716
Someone's got to pay
for what my mom did.

205
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:54,615
But you don't want to do this?

206
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:56,239
Dude, forget it.
Let's just go.

207
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,801
- I ...
- Aquamarine: Topaz, what are you

208
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,829
still doing down here,
you big boulder?

209
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:02,834
We're almost to Homeworld.

210
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,926
[Gasps]

211
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:10,843
What... are... you... doing?

212
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:12,674
Look, I can explain.

213
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,939
Um, they had this whole
heartfelt thing

214
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:17,908
about being there for each
other, and you missed it.

215
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:20,447
It was so moving.

216
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:24,322
[Gasps] No! Wait!

217
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,090
I can't see what's happening.
Are we still escaping?

218
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:33,056
No!
Nobody's escaping!

219
00:09:35,698 --> 00:09:37,468
Aquamarine,
let's talk about this.

220
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,130
Yeah, I-I bet you don't
really want to hurt us.

221
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:42,099
You ... You probably
just act mean

222
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:44,308
because deep down
you're afraid you're weak.

223
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,740
Go ahead. Let it out.
We're all sharing right now.

224
00:09:48,878 --> 00:09:51,878
Topaz, you had one job,

225
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:53,875
and if you're not
gonna do it,

226
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,317
you're of no use to me!

227
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:57,492
[Whimpers]

228
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:03,021
Ooh!

229
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,000
So... a revolt, huh?

230
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:12,733
And what do you plan to do
after this?

231
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:16,199
Go back to the Diamonds?
My gem in your hand?

232
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,739
I'm sure
they'll love that.

233
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:21,175
You'll be rewarded
handsomely

234
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,910
by being separated
and shattered.

235
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:27,815
[Clatters]

236
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,350
[Thuds]

237
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:32,916
What was I thinking?

238
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:35,156
That's the problem
with you fusions.

239
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:39,761
Sooner or later,
you all become sentimental.

240
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:42,256
[Rumbles]

241
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,498
We're here.

242
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:47,374
Look, just unfuse,

243
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:50,043
and we'll never speak of this
again.

244
00:10:55,244 --> 00:10:57,854
[Steven and Lars grunting]

245
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,210
Topaz, you don't have to do this.

246
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:02,919
[Grunting continues]

247
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:04,692
Wait. Lars!

248
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,760
- Steven, where are they taking us?!
- I don't know!

249
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,455
- Steven!
- Lars!
