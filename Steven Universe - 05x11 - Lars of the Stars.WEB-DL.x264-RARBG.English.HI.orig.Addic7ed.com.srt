- Sorry.

11
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:34,666
I just had to make sure
I had everything.

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,501
I bet Lars will really
appreciate this package

13
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,503
his parents put together
for him.

I'm so excited
we're finally going to have

16
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,844
a space adventure
together.

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,713
Steven and Connie
in space!

18
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,916
I'm not so sure
this is gonna be an adventure.

19
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,685
Last time I saw Lars,
he was huddled up in a dark cave

20

Homeworld fugitives.

21
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,389
Oh. Yeah.

for anything.

- Oh, my gah.

26
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,067
- We have to stay on task.
- Mm.

W-What is going on?

34
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,293
Captain,
I'm having a vision.

35
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,664
We're about to be discovered...
by Emerald!

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,302
- W-Wait. Captain?!
- W-Wait. Captain?!

37
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,339
Thanks, Padparadscha.

38
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,241
Fluorite,
how are the engines looking?

39
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:53,812
Le-e-t me-e-e
che-e-e-ck.

40
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,751
Twins, fire up
the nova thrusters.

41
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,954
- Yes, captain.
- Right away, captain.

42
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,758
<i>No! No!
Those are my nova thrusters!</i>

43
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,426
<i>That is my ship!</i>

44
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,662
Rhodonite,
everything clear up ahead?

45
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:11,797
For now.

46
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,367
<i>It was a minor inconvenience</i>

47
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:16,768
<i>when you stole
my personal shuttle</i>

48
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,004
<i>and crashed it
on Upsilon 9.</i>

49
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,539
<i>It was an insult</i>

50
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,440
<i>when you impersonated
imperial officers</i>

51
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,009
<i>during a cosmic jubilee.
[Both laughing]</i>

52
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:28,613
<i>But to steal my Sun Incinerator
is unacceptable!</i>

53
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,649
If this ship means
so much to you,

54
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,450
maybe you shouldn't
have left it unguarded

55
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,386
in the docking bay
of Klavius 7.

56
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,822
<i>There were 67 elite Citrines
guarding it!</i>

57
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,457
Oh. I didn't see them.

58
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,892
<i>No, wait. I did.</i>

59
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,827
<i>They didn't see us.</i>

60
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,362
<i>Oh, I'll get you!</i>

61
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,131
<i>I'll get you myself!</i>

62
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,799
<i>I'll do it right now.</i>

63
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,635
<i>[Chuckling] I'll blow you up
to smithereens!</i>

64
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,805
Good luck catching us.
We stole your fastest ship!

65
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,177
The engines are a-a-all se-e-t.

66
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,313
Twins, hyperspeed us
out of here.

67
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,414
- Right.
- Right.

68
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,150
<i>You will not go at hyperspeed!</i>

69
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,721
<i>- Bingo, bongo.
- Off colors!</i>

70
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,162
Man, she's been on my tail
since sector four.

71
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,498
That's like three sectors ago.
Get over it, right?

72
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,200
Lars!
I have so many questions!

73
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,668
Uh, where'd you get
this ship?

74
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,204
And more importantly,
where'd you get that cape?

75
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,039
[Chuckles] Stole 'em.

76
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,709
Ste-e-e-ven.

77
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:37,349
Is tha-a-t...another...
human frie-e-nd?

78
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,218
Yeah, I'm Connie.
Happy to be aboard.

79
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,354
You must all be Lars' crew.

80
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,189
[Chuckles]
They're more than that.

81
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,059
Without them, I'd still be stuck
in a cave on the Gem Homeworld.

82
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:51,062
They were able to figure out
a way off that lame old planet.

83
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,366
But we never would have been
able to steal a ship without Lars.

84
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,602
He can slip past
all the scanners undetected.

85
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,738
Her name is Connie.

86
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:03,308
And now a few stolen ships and
a couple of space crimes later,

87
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,277
we're finally on a course
toward Earth.

88
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,479
Hey, you know,
speaking of Earth,

89
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,381
your parents
put this together for you.

90
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,483
Oh!

91
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,553
Oh, finally! Clean jeans!

92
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,223
Oh, man!
And my skull gauges!

93
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,591
These are perfect!

94
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,395
[Sighs] They'd didn't
have to do all this.

95
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,397
I'll be back on Earth soon.

96
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,499
We are excited
about your Beach City.

97
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,068
I look forward to a planet
of sand and water.

98
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,772
Yeah! And my house.
And my trampoline.

99
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,240
The Big Donut!

100
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,475
And Sadie.

101
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,177
How is Sadie?

102
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,979
Oh, really,
really good!

103
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,415
Oh. Yeah?

104
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,184
Now she's Sadie Killer
and the Suspects.

105
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,652
Her band is awesome.

106
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,856
She looks really happy...

107
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,958
...without me.

108
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,427
[Alarm blaring]

109
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,829
What's going on?

110
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:01,132
Lars? Lars! Lars!

111
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,469
Captain Lars, a huge battleship
is approaching fast.

112
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,438
It'll be here
in just five quads.

113
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,439
What are your orders?

114
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,107
I don't believe this.

115
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,545
[Inhales] How is she having
such a good time without me?!

116
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,014
Does she even know
I died out here?!

117
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,217
Of course she does!
She's been worried sick!

118
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,186
Already three quads away.

119
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,620
What should we do?

120
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,390
<i>We could drop out of warp
and ambush them,</i>

121
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,958
but that might be
too risky.

122
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,128
Or maybe we find a nearby planet
to hide on?

123
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,197
I'm not sure!

124
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,832
What do you usually do?

125
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:34,899
Usually?

126
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,570
Usually we just follow
Captain Lars' orders!

127
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,806
Captain Lars has taken
so many risks on our behalf.

128
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,907
We need him!

129
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,142
Oh, no!

130
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,510
The warning alarm!

131
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,811
We're in danger!

132
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,647
Do you hear that?
Your crew needs you.

133
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,716
You don't get it,
do you, Steven?

134
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,985
[Sniffles]
It should be me.

135
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,421
[Crying] I'm the one
that should be hanging out

136
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,989
with the cool kids!

137
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,025
She's getting back at me
for everything I've done!

138
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,160
Do you really think

139
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,530
Sadie is living her life
just to get back at you?

140
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,534
Why else would she be having
so much fun without me?!

141
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,338
Because life goes on,
no matter what happens.

142
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,006
She was so upset
when she found out

143
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,741
you'd be stuck in space,
Lars.

144
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:20,678
She really misses you,
but she can't stay sad forever.

145
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,414
She started hanging out
with the cool kids.

146
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,115
She quit the Big Donut

147
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,185
<i>all because she needed to do
something to feel better.</i>

148
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,720
And look at you!

149
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:32,023
Steven said you'd be hiding
in some cave on Homeworld,

150
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,525
but you're not.

151
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,126
You're out here
fighting for freedom

152
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,595
with all your new friends
in tow!

153
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,632
Are you doing any of this
to hurt Sadie?

154
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,868
No! I'm doing this
because I have to.

155
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,205
I'd never do this
to hurt Sadie because ...

156
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,574
- Because!
- Because!

157
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,877
- Because you're best friends!
- Because you're best friends!

158
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,616
And best friends wouldn't do
anything to hurt each other.

159
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,985
Whoa.

160
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,390
It's here. An imperial warship
has just caught up to us.

161
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,759
- What?
- An imperial warship?

162
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,933
The Destiny Destroyer!

163
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,936
Their main weapons
are pointed right at us!

164
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,674
Hmm, pulling out
the big guns just for us, huh?

165
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,942
With a ship like that,

166
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,778
Emerald could wipe us out
in an instant,

167
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,913
if she really wanted to.

168
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,915
Of course she wants to!

169
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,485

<i>give off an energy signature
I could recognize</i>

176
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,934
<i>from the other side
of the galaxy.</i>

177
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:55,440
<i>Now surrender to me
or be destroyed!</i>

178
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,841
[Laughs]

179
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,443
I'd never surrender to you!

180
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,479
Blow us into stardust
like you've always dreamed of.

181
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,281
<i>Very well.</i>

182
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,951
<i>Prepare yourselves
for destruction!</i>

183
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,953
Lars,
what are you doing?!

184
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,622
Drop the shields,
Rhodonite.

185
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,790
But that would leave us open
to their attack!

186
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,626
We wouldn't stand
a chance!

187
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,561
Trust me,
we'll be just fine.

188
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,630
- Now lower the shields.
- But...

189
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,399
The destroyer's weapons
are charged at 90%.

190
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,335
They're preparing
to open fire!

191
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,138
Lower the shields!
That's an order!

192
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,575
[Gulps]
L-Lowering shields.

193
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,312
[All screaming]

194
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,180
Twins, what's our status?

195
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,850
Our weapons and shields have
been knocked offline, but...

196
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,818
Otherwise, we're fine.

197
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,988
We're still...alive!

198
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,391
The lasers
barely grazed us!

199
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,092
Emerald is about to attack,

200
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,763
but she's going to miss
on purpose.

201
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,431
[Chuckles]

202
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,667
Bingo, bongo!

203
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,202
<i>What do you think
you're doing?!</i>

204
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,906
[Laughing]

205
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,276
<i>You really do have a heart,
don't you, Emerald?</i>

206
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,544
<i>W-What?!</i>

207
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,213
You're not going to hurt
this ship!

208
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,449
You love this ship!

209
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,952
it's your best friend.

210
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,521
You'd much rather
let it get away than destroy it.

211
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,222
[Giggles]

212
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,691
Wow, Lars, I missed you.

213
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,125
<i>You're right about that.</i>

214
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,195
<i>I won't destroy
my beautiful ship.</i>

215
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,398
<i>But I will make it
so you can't get away!</i>

216
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,101
<i>Aim for their nova thrusters!</i>

217
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,302
[All shouting]

218
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,704
Evasive maneuvers!

219
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,872
If only our weapons and shields
were online.

220
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,874
I think she has us
this time.

221
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,077
<i>Unless we use that.</i>

222
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:39,911
That?!

223
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:43,381
<i>No-o-o-t tha-a-a-a-t.</i>

224
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,784
- What's that?
- The captain's experimental fighter jet

225
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,822
that only he knows how to drive.
It's too risky!

226
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,290
We're out of options.

227
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,827
But, Lars, your crew needs you
here on the ship.

228
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,261
You got a better idea?

229
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,831
Captain Lars,
permission to go in your place.

230
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,734
If it's anything like
driving a car, I should be fine.

231
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,403
Permission...granted!

232
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,938
Take out the enemy's
main cannons

233
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,275
while we get our weapons system
and shields back online.

234
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,611
Fluorite, how long
before we have full power

235
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:14,912
to shields and weapons?

236
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:19,684
Give me fi-i-ve minu-u-tes.

237
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,352
Can they really fly it?

238
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,622
If anyone can fly it, I'm sure
it's friends of our captain.

239
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,624
[Grunts] Whoa!

240
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,493
<i>It is like a car!</i>

241
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:32,096
<i>We'll watch your back while you
take out those guns. Now launch!</i>

242
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,933
<i>Captain Lars is about to give
the order to launch.</i>

243
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,370
Okay. Launching.

244
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,943
<i>Get in close!
They can't aim at themselves.</i>

245
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,513
Roger.
Target within range.

246
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,848
Targeting!

247
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,950
<i>One down! That's two!</i>

248
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,453
<i>Yes! All right!</i>

249
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,156
<i>Everything's almost fixed here.
Come on back.</i>

250
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,860
<i>Incoming missiles straight ahead!</i>

251
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,299
It's too late, Lars.
I can't...

252
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,300
[Screams]

253
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:14,272
<i>Steven?! Connie?!
Nooooo!</i>
