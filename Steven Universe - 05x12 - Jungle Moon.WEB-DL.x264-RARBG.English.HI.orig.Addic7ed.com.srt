There you are! We've been
looking all over for you!

Oh, my gosh, Lars!
It's so good to see you.

[Ship whirring]

198
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:10,133
Yeehaw!
Ugh, what the heck is that?!

199
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:12,803
I don't know, but it's not
here to play nice!

200
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:14,271

Looks like
we just saved your butts!

207
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:36,593
Lets get you up here
and back home through my head.
