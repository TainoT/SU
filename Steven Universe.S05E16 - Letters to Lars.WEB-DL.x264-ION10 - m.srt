2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:06,445
Captain's log...
I think it's Friday.

3
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:09,648
I've ordered Rhodonite to do
a spectral scan of the system.

4
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:11,265
Hopefully, one of
these asteroids

5
00:00:11,334 --> 00:00:12,394
has the Flotanium deposits

6
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:15,230
we need to get our
warp engines back online.

7
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:17,727
Hmm.

8
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:19,882
What now, Steven?

9
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:22,273
A letter?

10
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:27,309
"Dear Lars, how's space?
Is it still big?

11
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:29,250
You don't have to
answer that right now.

12
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:30,601
This is a letter.

13
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:32,946
Since you're away from home,
I thought I'd fill you in

14
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:34,718
on what's been going
on at Beach City.

15
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:36,907
Everyone misses you so much.

16
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:38,620
Since Sadie is busy
with the band,

17
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:41,356
no one is around
to open up the Big Donut."

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,710
Oh, come on.
Are they still not open?

19
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,891
Ugh.
I know Sadie quit a while ago,

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,140
but why the heck isn't Lars
here to pick up the slack?

21
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:55,852
Uh, Ronaldo,
Lars is in space.

22
00:00:58,507 --> 00:00:59,835
Good one, Steven.

23
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:01,640
I needed that.

24
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:07,143
You're serious?

25
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:10,382
Don't you remember when everyone
in town was abducted by Gems?

26
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:12,866
Mayor Dewey had to give
all those speeches about it.

27
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:15,515
Do you believe everything
the government tells you?

28
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:17,937
I'm the one who
told the government.

29
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:19,233
Wait, what?

30
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:21,093
So that means...
Mmhmm.

31
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:23,397
So Lars
is really in space?

32
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:25,632
Mm-hmm.
Is he in danger?

33
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:27,169
Surrounded by aliens?

34
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:28,694
All of the above.

35
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:30,804
This is a nightmare.

36
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:33,718
I'm the one who should
be in space!

37
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,647
Why does Lars get to be whisked
away into the infinite cosmos

38
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,062
on an adventure
of a lifetime?

39
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,288
It's so ironic
it hurts my soul.

40
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:48,468
- There, there.
- , Morning, Universe.

41
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:49,843
Oh, good morning.

42
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:51,426
Still not open, huh?

43
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:54,647
I guess me and the Big Donut
have a lot in common now.

44
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:57,210
We're both empty inside.

45
00:01:57,397 --> 00:01:59,093
"As far
as local politics,

46
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,884
Mayor Dewey
isn't mayor anymore.

47
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:02,593
There was an election
and Nanefua

48
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:04,673
won with her platform
of working together."

49
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,176
So we are all
in agreement, yes?

50
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:09,726
In the event of a Gem-related
emergency,

51
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:12,808
everyone should go to
the newly-designated shelters.

52
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:15,250
Me and Garnet can take
care of food rations.

53
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:18,087
Anyone know a good,
non-perishable brand of chaps?

54
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:21,590
You can also put some pizza
ingredients on ice just in case.

55
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,433
That's a great idea, Garnet.

56
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:26,801
We can ask all the local
restaurants to pitch in food

57
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,630
in case we have
to hide for awhile.

58
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:31,379
These all seem like
great plans,

59
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:34,410
but how are you going
to get in contact

60
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,417
with everyone when
there is an emergency?

61
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:39,957
This may be a small town,
but it's a big small town.

62
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:42,292
Oh, Mayor Gunga, I could
drive you around

63
00:02:42,432 --> 00:02:44,980
while you use the loudspeaker
to spread the word through town.

64
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:47,764
Cheese on bread!
That's a good idea.

65
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:50,706
While Jenny does that, I can
take to the boardwalk on foot

66
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:52,988
and let all the businesses
know what's up.

67
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:56,291
And as soon as we know
of any impending danger,

68
00:02:56,378 --> 00:03:00,110
I'll give everyone a call
on my cellular phone.

69
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:03,386
It might be easier if you
just sent out a mass text.

70
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,667
What number do I call
for mass text?

71
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:08,971
Pearl, is this your
first cell phone?

72
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:10,175
Maybe.

73
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:13,581
Is there anything else we can do
to beef up the town's security?

74
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:16,026
It would be nice if we could
have some kind of lookout.

75
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,403
Maybe I'll pick up one of
the high-powered telescopes

76
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:19,982
for the lighthouse
or something.

77
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,965
I volunteer!
I love looking out.

78
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:25,214
If I can't be in space,
then I can at least look at it.

79
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:27,098
This is beautiful.

80
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:30,040
Ronaldo, Greg,
you're on lookout duty.

81
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:33,328
Kiki, Pearl, you are
in charge of communication.

82
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:36,780
Steven, Garnet,
you call for rations.

83
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:40,102
And Jenny and I will spread
the word about the plan.

84
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,906
Now everyone is helping
to make our town safe.

85
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:47,073
Everyone except me.

86
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,723
Aww.

87
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:51,956
Oh, you made
things awkward.

88
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:55,332
"Sadie Killer and the
Suspects are still going strong.

89
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:58,220
They're gearing up for a huge
show right here in Beach City.

90
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:00,889
I hope you can make it back
in time to see them play."

91
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:03,058
And just as the chorus
is finishing up,

92
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:05,981
I'll grab this fake
but very realistic chainsaw,

93
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,796
and then Steven will hit me
with the lights,

94
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:09,431
and we'll all scream.

95
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:10,932
Aah. Aah.

96
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,518
And then I'll come out.

97
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:16,823
Oogity boogity.

98
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,807
I don't think
you get it, Dad.

99
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:22,386
We're going for scary scary,
not ha-ha scary.

100
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:26,605
Oh. All right.
I just wanted to help.

101
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:29,366
Did you cut holes
in my bedsheets?

102
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,980
"Jamie the mailman has
been making a lot of progress

103
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,824
establishing
a local theater scene.

104
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:35,380
He's done a bunch
of one-man shows

105
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,459
and even started
teaching improv."

106
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:43,499
People of Beach City, are you
ready to laugh your butts off?

107
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:44,781
I am!

108
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:47,692
We got a killer lineup
for you tonight,

109
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:53,142
so please welcome
the Beach City Laugh Guards.

110
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:54,891
Whoo!
Yeah!

111
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:56,951
Now all we need to get started

112
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,780
is a single word
from the audience.

113
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:00,030
Steven!

114
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:02,566
We do a scene
about Steven every week.

115
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:04,953
Well, I think
those scenes are good.

116
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,457
Uh, spaghetti!
No. No. Uh, car.

117
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,857
No. That's not good.

118
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:10,792
Oh, how about plumber?

119
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,375
I heard "plumber."

120
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:16,031
And now the Beach City Laugh
Guards will perform a completely

121
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:20,028
improvised scene based
on the word plumber.

122
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:21,670
No.
Do Steven!

123
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:23,086
Wait, cats!

124
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:26,056
And no more suggestions
for the rest of the show.

125
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,310
Thanks for coming out
on such short notice.

126
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:29,778
My sink is clogged.

127
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:33,371
Well, looks like we're going
to need one of these.

128
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:36,403
No, no, no. Cut. Stop.

129
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,082
Notes... Barb, love how you
set up the scene.

130
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,038
Amethyst, you don't have
to "become" a plunger.

131
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,095
Just pretend to have one.
Observe and learn.

132
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:51,515
Ah...

133
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:53,142
Ooh.

134
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:55,371
Uh...

135
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,487
What?
Wow.

136
00:05:57,723 --> 00:06:01,525
That's way too confusing.
You could be holding anything.

137
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:02,840
I'm holding a plunger.

138
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:03,840
Oh.

139
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:06,965
I thought you were holding a
long, skinny submarine sandwich.

140
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:08,650
Pearl!
Be nice.

141
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:11,029
It's obviously
much more clear

142
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:13,512
if you can see
the actual plunger.

143
00:06:13,903 --> 00:06:15,381
She's got a point,
there, dude.

144
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:19,709
Looks like
I improved improv.

145
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,678
Did I miss my cue?

146
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:23,164
Oh.
Whatever.

147
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:24,781
Hello, ladies.

148
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:27,536
It's me, the waiter
in this restaurant.

149
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:31,099
Can I offer you some more worms?

150
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:32,914
Blackout.

151
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:35,545
It was better
than last week.

152
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:37,279
"Anyways,
my dad is still rich

153
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:39,123
even after buying
that telescope,

154
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:41,998
so he's been trying out
rich people sports.

155
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:45,443
He an Garnet have been playing
tennis on the weekends."

156
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:52,409
Garnet, this is a little
intense for a warm-up.

157
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:54,896
Maybe we could try
a light volley?

158
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:56,746
This is light.

159
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:58,767
Being rich
has made you week.

160
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,795
Oh, hey, tennis.

161
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:03,149
Room for one m... Ow!

162
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,883
"In other
sports-related news,

163
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:10,985
Beach City Underground Wrestling
has been intense lately.

164
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,248
The Marmalade Boys
fought each other in,

165
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:15,532
you guessed it, marmalade.

166
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:16,952
The crowd was eating it up,

167
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,254
but not literally because
that would be gross.

168
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:22,090
Concrete Heat faced off
against the Wolf of Wall Street

169
00:07:22,177 --> 00:07:23,740
inside a steel cage,

170
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:26,461
and the Good-Looking Gang
finally lost the Tag-Team Title

171
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:28,778
to the Sea Wasp
and Shark-o-mania.

172
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:30,655
I know you don't
need to eat anymore,

173
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:32,186
but I thought you'd
still be interested

174
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:34,161
in the local french fry scene
in Beach City.

175
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:37,053
Peedee started his
very own food truck.

176
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,526
He's not old enough
to drive yet, though,

177
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:40,942
so it's kind of just
another fry stand."

178
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,161
Hey, Steven.
What will it be?

179
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:44,446
What have you got?

180
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:48,031
Well, I deal exclusively
in tater tots now.

181
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:50,752
That's great, Peedee.
Can I get the bits?

182
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,136
Uh, why don't you
try the tots?

183
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:55,360
They're the fry
of the future.

184
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,125
Do the tots have bits?

185
00:07:57,212 --> 00:08:00,271
I'll get you the bits.

186
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,708
I like your super-cool truck,
Peedee.

187
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:04,825
I love the giant potato
on the top.

188
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,849
Oh, thanks. It actually used
to be the Mayor Mobile.

189
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,832
I just painted over
Mayor Dewey's head.

190
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:12,246
It's a good thing that his head
was so big and lumpy.

191
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:13,396
Yeah.

192
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:15,936
The new city board practically
just gave it to me, too.

193
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:18,810
It's like they wanted nothing
to do with it anymore.

194
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,491
Everything has been
pretty great for me

195
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,122
since Nanefua became mayor.

196
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:25,122
Oh, no.

197
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:27,591
All right.
I got the bits.

198
00:08:27,777 --> 00:08:29,263
Steven?

199
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,610
Mayor Dewey, wait!

200
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:37,332
You know, Universe,
seeing my old Mayor Mobile

201
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,943
turned into a giant potato

202
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:43,405
made me realize that nothing
is like it used to be.

203
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,575
My old life, my old town,
my old citizens,

204
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:48,411
they've all changed.

205
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:51,194
They've all outgrown me,
I suppose.

206
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,215
Well, of course
everyone is changing.

207
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:55,198
Nothing can stay
the same forever.

208
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,853
You know what I miss the most
about being the mayor?

209
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,638
The little things, getting
dressed and ready for work,

210
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:03,158
walking down the boardwalk

211
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:06,724
seeing everyone's
smiling faces, yes.

212
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:09,512
Knowing I had a place
in this town.

213
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:12,282
I used to look forward
to it every day,

214
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:14,403
just like the people
of this town

215
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,396
used to look forward
to their morning donut.

216
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:20,763
I guess these days no one
gets what they want.

217
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:23,827
Wait a second.
I have an idea.

218
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:27,163
"And so Mayor Dewey started
working at the Big Donut.

219
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,366
It seemed as if
the entire town showed up

220
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,667
for the grand reopening.

221
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:34,055
The whole thing filled Mr. Dewey
with a new sense of purpose.

222
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,139
He's really changing
things up, too.

223
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:37,818
Well, not really,
but he is naming

224
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:39,628
all the donuts after himself."

225
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:41,632
Next in line, please.

226
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,365
I'll have a regular glazed.

227
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,958
One Classic Dewey
coming up.

228
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:49,630
And how about a freshly fried
Dewey Roll on the house?

229
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:51,054
Take it easy, Billy.

230
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:53,074
You're going to go
out of business.

231
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:54,858
Ha ha!
You're cute.

232
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:58,302
"But there is one donut
that's not named after Dewey.

233
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,498
He let me name
a donut after you.

234
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:03,785
It's a pink donut
with pink sprinkles.

235
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:06,436
I call it the Pink Lars.

236
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:10,083
Even though you're in space,
there's still a part of you here

237
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:12,404
in sweet, delicious donut form.

238
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,529
You got to try one
when you get back.

239
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:17,999
Anyway, hope this letter
finds you in good spirits.

240
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:20,747
Love, Steven."

241
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:24,467
I appreciate the letter,
but why did you write this

242
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:27,108
if you were just going to tell
me everything in person anyway?

243
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,341
Sometimes
it's nice to be read to.

244
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:32,514
You realize I don't know who
half of these people are, right?

245
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:34,950
Like, who the heck is Peridot?

246
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,369
Someone who misses you
every day, I think.

247
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:41,785
You know what?
You haven't met before.

248
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,068
I'll have to introduce you
when you get back to Earth.

249
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,216
Huh.
Thanks for the letter, Steven.
