Do you want to
talk about it?

33
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:25,787
Um, it's just space lag

34
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,021
from when
I went to space.

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,837
Hmm.

36
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:38,890
Ah!

37
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:42,131
Wait. No.
I need to play it cool.

38
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:44,651
I'm just gonna assume
by your silence

39
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:45,846
that you're entangled within

40
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:47,912
the immersive koala lore
of the show.

41
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,854
Did you get to the part
where Koala Princess

42
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:51,299
and Kanga-Roofus kiss?

43
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:55,506
Steven, you want to help
us with these groceries?

44
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:57,334
Coming.

45
00:01:58,232 --> 00:01:59,802
Eh? Eh?

46
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:02,470
Check this out, Steven.

47
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:06,658
It's farm fresh.

48
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:10,411
Uh, thanks guys,
but the fridge is full.

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,967
Not the fridge
at our vacation house.

50
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,794
- Whoo!
- Vacation.

51
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:19,178
I thought,
"Why spend money on hoses

52
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:21,423
when I can spend it
on houses?"

53
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,120
So I found a place
we could rent

54
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:25,084
for the weekend
by searching online.

55
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:27,229
Back in the old days
we just went door-to-door

56
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:28,779
hoping one was unlocked,

57
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,999
but this is the new days.

58
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:33,068
Okay. Well, have fun.

59
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:36,045
Uh, Steven, you're going
on vacation, too.

60
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:39,678
Oh, yes.

61
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:41,876
This is the perfect time
for a vacation.

62
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:45,388
I mean, how often are we
on the same planet together?

63
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:48,287
Yeah. And you'll be
with your favorite Gems

64
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:49,763
and your favorite dad.

65
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,453
Agree with Amethyst.

66
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,717
Turn to Steven.

67
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:54,381
Steven, you should go.

68
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:56,323
No,
with more enthusiasm.

69
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:58,627
Steven,
it's a vacation!

70
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,932
I mean, I would,
but I'm really tied up

71
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,334
with something important.

72
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:05,209
In the end,
the wombats were for naught,

73
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,209
but it really
makes you think.

74
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,788
I'll go.

75
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:10,442
Aced it.

76
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,237
Here it is,

77
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:17,745
temporary home
sweet temporary home.

78
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:22,506
- Is that my bed?
- Yeah.

79
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:24,717
I want you to be
a comfortable as possible,

80
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:26,622
finally have
some family time.

81
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:29,006
I feel like you haven't
had that in a while.

82
00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:30,849
Yeah, maybe.

83
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:32,131
This place is great.

84
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:34,028
They have one
of those refrigerators

85
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:35,529
that dispense water,

86
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:39,368
not to mention four windows
and an analog clock!

87
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:41,343
Hmm, says here
we can't use

88
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:43,739
the water dispenser
or the clock.

89
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:46,646
Windows must be kept
closed at all times,

90
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:49,381
and remove all shoes
before entering.

91
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:51,138

anyone else, party guy,

hissing, reptilian?

No.

95
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,894
Well, you might want
to factor in a plus one.

96

- I promise.

is even more messed up.

181
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,568
I left her behind
to go to Homeworld

182
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:51,267
after promising we'd face
everything together.

183
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:53,335
I'm sure I really hurt her.

184
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:56,123
I've been calling
and texting her for a week,

185
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,794
but she hasn't
responded once.

186
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:01,361
Connie might never
talk to me again.

187
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:04,657
Steven!

188
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:05,831
I'll go get him.

189
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,722
I don't know anything
about Homeworld,

190
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,704
but I know about this.

191
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:12,592
Steven?
Steven?

192
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:14,533
Steven's not here.

193
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:16,385
Oh, that's too bad.

194
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:18,178
So I guess I'll just
talk to this

195
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:20,494
Steven-shaped barrel
instead.

196
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:21,858
If you must.

197
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,151
Schtuball, if this was
about Connie,

198
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,377
why didn't you say
anything sooner?

199
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:29,069
I was embarra...

200
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:32,939
You were embroidered,
embroiled,

201
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,330
emboldened to talk
to your old man

202
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:36,755
about your problems?

203
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:38,882
I was embarrassed,
okay?

204
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,056
You and the Gems
all liked Connie,

205
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,392
and I was worried that if you
heard what happened

206
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:45,373
that you'd be
mad at me too.

207
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:48,517
Oh, Steven, of course
we're not mad.

208
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:50,635
And I'm sure
Connie's not mad, either.

209
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:53,580
Well, at least I'm sure
she doesn't hate you.

210
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:56,725
That whole handing-yourself
over-to-Homeworld thing

211
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:59,135
was definitely
a high-stress situation.

212
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,486
It really scared
all of us.

213
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:03,291
I'm not exactly
over it either,

214
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,826
but I guess
carting you off

215
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:06,780
to the middle of nowhere
to spend time with you

216
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,525
is my way
of dealing with it.

217
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:11,840
Maybe having some distance
from you is Connie's way.

218
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,068
But the last thing I did was
send her a bunch of dumb texts.

219
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,005
I made some weird joke
about tennis,

220
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:18,790
and I don't even know
if it makes sense.

221
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:20,664
- Tennis?
- See?

222
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:22,489
No wonder
she hasn't responded.

223
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:26,677
Uh, Steven, you don't
get any service out here.

224
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:29,848
What are you
even telling me?

225
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,885
Maybe she's been
trying to get in touch

226
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:33,825
with me this whole time,
and I haven't seen it!

227
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:35,763
What if she thinks
I'm ignoring her?

228
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,677
Dad! We have to
find cell service.

229
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:38,864
Right.

230
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:40,831
Go, go, go!

231
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:43,365
Okay.

232
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:45,120
Floor it!

233
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:48,183
How we doing?

234
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:49,980
Take a right.

235
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:51,628
Nah, back up.

236
00:09:51,686 --> 00:09:53,722
No, wait!
Keep going.

237
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,545
We're heading
for a cliff, buddy.

238
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:00,849
Just a little further.

239
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,878
Gonna have to stop soon.

240
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:04,226
Almost got it.

Yes!
We've got service.

Steven! When I didn't
hear back from you,

245
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:19,800
I was sure a nefarious plot
was afoot.

246
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:21,683
Well?

247
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,455
No. No messages

I know it hurts now,

I know.
I need to let it go.

Got room for three more?

Always.
