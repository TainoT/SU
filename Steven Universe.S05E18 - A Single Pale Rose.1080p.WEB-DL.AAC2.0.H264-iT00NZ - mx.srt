2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:07,953
I watched the leader
of the Crystal Gems,

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:12,155
Rose Quartz, shatter
Pink Diamond!

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:15,580
So how did a rose quartz,

5
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:18,596
with no business
being anywhere near

6
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:22,171
Pink Diamond, get so close
in the first place?

7
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:23,766
Aagh!

8
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:27,056
I can't believe you've had
your phone for a month

9
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,734
and you haven't
used it at all!

10
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:30,455
That's not true!

11
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:32,656
I use it to tell the time!

12
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,152
Sigh. Come here, P.

13
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:38,914
Ugh. Let's change
your wallpaper.

14
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:41,492
Looks great!

15
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:44,552
Okay, now texting
is in the messages.

16
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:46,849
Just click on this green icon.

17
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:49,175
- Pearl, can I ask you someth...
- Hold on, Steve-o,

18
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:51,075
I'm in
the middle of a demonstration!

19
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,967
Okay, anyway, and you can type,

20
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:55,222
I mean, pretty much
anything you want.

21
00:00:58,598 --> 00:01:00,355
You really should
have a case for this.

22
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:02,223
I do!

23
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:08,881
Okay. I have a bunch of actual
phone cases in my room. Hup!

24
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:11,979
Don't throw that thing against a
rock or anything until I'm back.

25
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:20,894
Pearl...
What is it, Steven?

26
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:24,792
You remember how Mom
shattered Pink Diamond?

27
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,800
Well, I was just wondering

28
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:29,979
if maybe<i> you</i> shattered
Pink Diamond?

29
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,551
I...

30
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:35,097
I-It's okay!
You can tell me!

31
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:41,026
Why can't you just
talk to me about this?!

32
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,753
I got the...

33
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:45,878
phone case.

34
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:49,707
Oh, yes! The phone case!
Thank you, Amethyst!

35
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:51,224
Ha ha... whoops! So clumsy.

36
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,566
It's probably safer
if I just keep it in here.

37
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:54,870
Wait, come on!

38
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:58,339
Just put it in this,
then put it in your head!

39
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:00,612
What was that?

40
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,417
"I want to tell you,
but I can't"?!

41
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:16,044
Pearl, I'm ready to talk!

42
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:17,425
Uh, what?!

43
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,099
I-I got your text.

44
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:22,136
"I want to tell you but I
can't," with a monkey emoji?

45
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:24,670
Steven, I didn't send that.

46
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:28,069
I haven't used my phone since
I put it away this morning.

47
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:31,457
Maybe you butt dialed me...
with your gem?

48
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,706
No, that's impossible.

49
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:37,214
Hang on, I'll pull it out, and
we'll get to the bottom of this.

50
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,653
See, here.

51
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:42,283
See, I...

52
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:44,662
Maybe this? No.

53
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:46,092
Maybe this?

54
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,995
No. Maybe... may-may this?

55
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:51,560
No.
Pearl, are you okay?

56
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:54,045
Ugh. Where could I have put it?

57
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:56,097
I know it's in there somewhere.

58
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,456
You just sent another one!

59
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:06,592
Steven... I need you to go
inside my gem and find my phone.

60
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:09,074
What? I-is it stuck
in there or something!?

61
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:12,168
There are certain things
I can't tell you,

62
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:16,068
but I can tell you
that I need my phone.

63
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:19,115
Please!
I can bring you back out

64
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:21,522
once you find what
you're looking for.

65
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,592
Your phone...
Exactly!

66
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:27,562
I'll keep your phone, text me
with mine when you find it.

67
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:33,301
Huh!

68
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,573
There's a Pearl
inside Pearl's pearl?

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,649
Oh, Steven!
Where should I put you?

70
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,496
Certainly not with the spears.

71
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:52,222
Human paraphernalia?
Personal items?

72
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,901
Let's just go alphabetical.
S... S-T...

73
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,810
Wait, no! Don't file me!

74
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:59,785
You sent me in here
for your cell phone!

75
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:00,942
My phone?

76
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:03,519
Well, all right, let's see.

77
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:06,167
P-H-O-...

78
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:09,503
Ah, hmm. Nothing.

79
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:12,115
Oh, it's a cellular phone!

80
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:13,879
I must have put it under "C"!

81
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:17,425
It should be right... here.

82
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:20,214
It should be right here!

83
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,599
Unless... some other me took it.

84
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,144
There's more of you in here?

85
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:28,440
Oh, no, not here.
I made sure of that.

86
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:31,724
I'm very good at
compartmentalizing everything.

87
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:35,459
That's why I get to be surface,
and they have to be put away.

88
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:37,847
Well, if one of those
Pearls has the phone,

89
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:39,339
can you tell me
where to find her?

90
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,355
Oh, you don't want
to go where they are.

91
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,912
It's a mess.
Let's just stay here,

92
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,425
where everything
is alphabetized!

93
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:49,581
Come on, I can handle it!

94
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:53,948
All right. Don't say
I didn't warn you.

95
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:01,667
This doesn't look like a mess.

96
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:04,706
It looks like... the past.

97
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:12,565
Oh, that kind of mess.

98
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:18,698
Hey, Pearl inside Pearl
inside Pearl's pearl.

99
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:22,604
You upset about the whole
missing phone situation, too?

100
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,865
No, it's Rose!

101
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:27,800
What was she thinking?!

102
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:30,146
She can't have a baby!

103
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:32,170
Well, this is awkward.

104
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:35,558
What am I going to do
when she disappears?

105
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:40,065
I'm going to lose her,
just like I lost my...

106
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,058
What was it you said?

107
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:43,496
Your cell phone?

108
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:46,760
My cell phone!

109
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:48,498
Look, it's going to be okay!

110
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:51,831
That's why you sent me in here,
I'm going to help you find it.

111
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:53,972
I think I know where it is.

112
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:57,378
It's probably where I
lost everything else.

113
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:10,967
Huh?

114
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:17,747
It better not turn out that
her phone was in her pocket...

115
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:20,390
or she left it on the dresser
or dropped it in the toilet.

116
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,114
Seems about as likely
as putting it away

117
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:24,020
in your repressed war memories.

118
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:25,867
Pearl?

119
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:28,413
I mean, Pearl inside Pearl
inside Pearl

120
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,607
inside Pearl's pearl!

121
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:31,927
Is this really about
your phone or what!

122
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:33,707
We're the only ones left.

123
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:37,304
Homeworld...
they were all leaving.

124
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:38,965
We thought we'd won.

125
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:42,690
There was a bright light
and everyone was...

126
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:45,041
Why did I do it?
What do you mean?

127
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:47,081
Just tell me!

128
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:04,162
Mom?

129
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,872
I thought this was Pearl's...

130
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,286
What are you doing here?

131
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,727
W-what?!

132
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,248
I... I knew it!

133
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:24,317
It was you
who shattered her.

134
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,356
Pink Diamond?

135
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:33,723
But... I don't understand.

136
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:41,816
The palanquin?

137
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:46,950
And then you'll be done!
It's going to be easy!

138
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:49,405
There's got to be another way!

139
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:50,586
I mean, maybe...

140
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:52,599
Blue and yellow don't care!

141
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:53,835
They never have!

142
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:56,114
This is "Pink Diamond's" colony.

143
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:58,934
We can end it all
right here, right now.

144
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,286
You know this is crazy, right?

145
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,176
Your status, my purpose...
None of it will matter anymore.

146
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:11,512
This will change everything.

147
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:14,309
I know. Isn't it exciting?

148
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:17,333
It is!

149
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:19,622
We can leave
our old lives behind.

150
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,491
If this is really my world,

151
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,482
I want to give it
to the Crystal Gems.

152
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:26,114
I want to live here
with human beings.

153
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:30,504
I want to live here with you!
We'll both finally be free!

154
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:33,746
Okay, I'm ready!

155
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,912
Pearl!

156
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:40,723
I can't believe
I'm going to do this.

157
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:44,246
I can't exactly
shatter myself.

158
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,910
Convincing?

159
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:30,995
Very much so, my diamond.

160
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:34,401
Soon it will be just "Rose."

161
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:40,183
Wait. There's one last
thing I need to do.

162
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,270
Yes?

163
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:44,229
No one can ever
find out we did this.

164
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:46,213
I never want to look back.

165
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:51,502
So, for my last order
to you as a diamond, please,

166
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:53,877
let's never speak of this again.

167
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,167
No one can know.

168
00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:10,875
Sorry to make you
come all this way.

169
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,363
I know.

170
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,783
I wanted to tell you
for so long.

171
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:45,447
Mom was Pink Diamond.

172
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,761
What?!

173
