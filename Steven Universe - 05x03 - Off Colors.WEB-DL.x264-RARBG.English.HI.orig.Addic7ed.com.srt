Dude, those giant ladies
were furious with you.

They're the diamonds.

18
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:53,951
They've been after my mom
for 6,000 years,

19
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:55,611
and now they're after me.

Come on.
We got to move.

There's tons of food
if you like rocks for dinner.

Salt is a rock, right?

it won't see us!

in a movie once.

I was scared of that, too.

making baklava

I hope you weren't followed.

00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,085
You weren't, right?
You double-checked?

strangers to our current

already happened.

terrible robonoids.

Don't tell me you tried to fight
those things.

00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:08,129
No, no.
Of course not.

116
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:10,298

were about to be scanned

117

when we pulled them under.

Aah!

123
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:27,492
They don't look
like Gems.

124
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,920
That's what I said!

125
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:30,315

Hi! I'm Steven.
I'm a Gem.

00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:34,326
Well, half-gem.

128

He's all human.

129
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,940

so unusual.

Of course you do!

132
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,540
You can't just walk around
on the surface like that!

133
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:52,236
You're off-color ...
just like the rest of us!

134
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:55,109
What do you mean,
off-color?

135
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:56,848
You know, wrong.

136
00:05:56,883 --> 00:05:58,023
Not, right.

137
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:59,381
Flawed.

138
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,359
Wait, I don't see anything wrong
with you guys.

139
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,060
Gems like us aren't needed.

140
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:14,874
Padparadscha can only predict
things that just happened.

Here comes Fluorite!

142
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,540
And a fusion like me
is unforgivable.

143
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:23,713
When my ...
our Morganite found out,

144
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,213
let's just say
we were replaced.

145
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:27,646
But my story's nothing!

146
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:30,881
I mean, Fluorite,
how many Gems are you now?

147
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:31,877
Six.

148
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,918
Maybe more,
if we meet the right Gem.

149
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:38,386
And then there's us!

150
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:40,755
You mean, you're not a fusion?

151
00:06:40,794 --> 00:06:43,904
We're just a rutile
that came out wrong.

152
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,070
We survived
because all the other rutiles

153
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,830
ran away when we emerged.

154
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:52,098
We survived because
they were afraid of us.

155
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:53,468
Afraid of you?

156
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:57,176
So you've been hiding
your whole lives.

157
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,746
- What happens if they find you?
- We'll be...

158
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:04,252
Shattered.

Ah! You were followed!
They're gonna find us!

00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:16,925
They're gonna break us!

165
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:20,098
This is our fault!
If it wasn't for us, you'd be fine!

166
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:21,933
We couldn't
just leave you there.

167
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:23,098
We had to do something.

168
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:26,266
Steven?
What're we gonna do?

169
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:28,006
Everyone hide!

170
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,950

It's okay to be afraid.

181
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:29,603
Oh, my gosh! Lars!

182
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:31,396
They were trying to scan
your Gem!

183
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:32,938
They can't see you
at all!

184
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,012
All right!

185
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,670
Looks like the tables
have turned!

186
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,178
- Human Lars.
- [Gasps]

187
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,250
I've been possessed
by the most marvelous vision!

188
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:42,351
Huh?

189
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:46,382
You, human Lars,
are Gemless,

190
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:48,919
and will be safe
from the robonoids,

191
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:51,585
which only target Gems!

192
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:01,901
I think that's the coolest thing
I've ever done in my life.

193
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:03,895
It's not over yet.

194
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:12,507
[Grunts]

195
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:20,916
Huh?

196
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:28,662
Oh.
The shield is reflective.

197
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:31,955
Padparadscha, come back!
Hide!

198
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,400
Okay.

199
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:40,168
Okay.

200
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:42,006
Okay!

201
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:47,148
Whoa-oh-oh!

202
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,010
Whoa! Aah!

203
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,949
Whoa!

204
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:55,145
Eat this!

205
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:04,434
Lars!

206
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:07,434
Lars?

207
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:08,697
Lars?

208
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:10,095
I didn't think
we were gonna make it!

209
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:11,936
- That was amazing!
- Lars, that was so great.

210
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:13,441
- You were amazing.
- We're winning!

211
00:10:13,473 --> 00:10:15,843
We're winning!

212
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:21,182
[Gasps]

213
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:23,054
[Crying]

214
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:04,355
[Groans]

215
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,262
Whoa.
What happened?

216
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,594
Oh, my!

217
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:12,029
Something incredible
is going to happen to Lars!
