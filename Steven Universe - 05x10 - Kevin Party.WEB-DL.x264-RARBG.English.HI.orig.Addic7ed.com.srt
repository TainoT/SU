- Beat it, Kevin.

I'm throwing a party
at my parents' palatial estate.

All the coolest teens
in Delmarva have RSVP'd

the only one cooler than I am.

Are you talking about me?

What? No! Ew!

- I'm talking about Stevonnie.
- W-What?!

You can't just ...
[Grumbles]

This is the last thing
I need right now.

18

Look, Stevonnie is better
than me, okay?

19

Better dancer, better driver.

20
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:59,364
Stevonnie truly does not care
what anyone thinks.

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,566
That's why they're the coolest.

If I can't be the coolest,

23
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,771
I at least got to be seen
hanging with the coolest.

24
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:09,741
Stevonnie only exists
when Connie and I are together,

25
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:13,645

I'm not coming.

all of this to her, too?

old grandparents,

- What? No, no, no!

176
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:57,815
[Sighs] Anyway,
I'm glad you're doing well.

177
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,318
That's all I really wanted to know.

178
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:03,054
No, no! But ...
But you're my best friend!

179
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:06,357
Best friend?! What are you kids
even talking about?

180
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:07,792
I thought she was your ex.

181
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:10,161
Great.
Now what am I gonna do?

182
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:11,662
Think, Kevin.

183
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:15,199
How do people treat their friends?

184
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:16,667
Connie!

185
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:19,070
Wait, wait, Connie.
Don't go.

186
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:22,173
Steven, I wasn't trying
to ignore you.

187
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,841
I was going to text you back.

188
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:27,078
I-I wrote,
"I can't talk to you right now,"

189
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:28,846
but then I realized if I sent it,

190
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:30,548
that would be talking to you.

191
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,918
<i>And it didn't make any sense.
I wasn't making any sense.</i>

192
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:35,553
If we were
going to talk,

193
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:37,522
I thought it's got to be in person.

194
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:39,090
So I rode Lion to your house,

195
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,392
but there was a note that said,
"Gone vacationing,"

196
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:44,829
and then I ran into Kevin
and he said you'd be here,

197
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:47,865
but, uh, maybe this is still too soon.

198
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,535
I-I don't even know
what to say to you.

199
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,203
I'm angry.

200
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:53,604
I miss you.

201
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,374
I feel like
I'm out of my mind.

202
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:57,575
No, you're not.

203
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,577
I surrendered myself
to Homeworld.

204
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:01,712
I let them take me away,
maybe forever,

205
00:09:01,747 --> 00:09:05,883
and then I came back and I tried
to act like it was no big deal.

206
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:07,185
<i>But it was a big deal.</i>

207
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,686
I couldn't stand
the thought

208
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:10,455
of you being taken away
on that spaceship,

209
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,523
but then I did that to you.

210
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:17,095
I promised you we'd always be
a team, and I let you down.

211
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,629
I'm sorry.

212
00:09:18,664 --> 00:09:20,098
Jam buds?

213
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:22,400
Jam buds.

214
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,871
It's so good to talk to you.

215
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:28,306
I've been wanting to see you
so bad

216
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:33,077
I accepted a party invitation
from Kevin. [Chuckles]

217
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:35,746
I know. I took his advice.

218
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:38,316
[Chuckles]

219
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:41,619
I think he got is heart broken.
I-It's actually really sad.

220
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:43,821
[Chuckles]
Of course he did.

221
00:09:43,856 --> 00:09:47,725
- [Chuckles] Hey, nice shirt.
- Nice hair.

222
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,827
[Chuckles] Thank you.

223
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:53,564
All right!
Hey, everybody, are you having fun?

224
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:54,966
Together: Yeah!

225
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:57,735
Liars!
You're all so fake.

226
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,904
You make me sick.
But get ready.

227
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:02,673
I'm gonna introduce you
to somebody so real

228
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,842
you'll all feel as sick as me!

229
00:10:04,877 --> 00:10:08,579
This party starts now!
Children! Go!

230
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:12,450
[Music]

231
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:15,920
It's pretty late.
We should head out.

232
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:17,788
Thanks for all your help, Kevin.

233
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:20,992
What? [Microphone thuds]
You got to do the thing.

234
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:24,328
What did I help you for if
you're not gonna elevate my party?

235
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:27,431
Wha...? Hey!
Don't you walk away from...

236
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:28,799
[Water splashes]

237
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,935
[Gasping]

238
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,205
[Derrick laughs]

239
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,540
Shut up, Derrick!

240
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:39,510
If it helps, Kevin, I think
you threw a very nice party.

241
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:41,612
Mm-hmm.
Good night!

242
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:43,848
[Roars]
No! Wait!

243
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,616
[Partygoers cheering]

244
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:48,297
[Groans]
[Pop!]
