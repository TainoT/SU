Great Job,
Bulbasaur. Ha.

194
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,120
You Did It.

Uhh!

222
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,960
Oh, No!

223
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,720
We Did It!

224
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,720
Pika!

225
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,720
Well, That Sure Was
A Shocking Ending.

226
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,200
Shocking That Ash
Moved So Fast.

227
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Toge!

228
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760

Pikachu.

230
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
There's
Another Credit

231
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,240
On Pikachu's
Charge Account.

232
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,760
We've Got To Grab It.

233
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,760
I Know We Got To Grab Some
Rare Pokemon For The Boss,

234
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
But It Wouldn't Be
Such A Bad Idea

235
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,760
If We Grabbed A Little
Bite To Eat, Would It?

236
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,760
We Didn't Come Here
To Steal A Meal.

237
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,760
I'd Settle For A Taste
Of That Pika-Chow.

238
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,280
Pika. Pika.
Pika.

239
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280

00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
I Can Cook Something.

242
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,280
Thanks, But The Last Time
You Cooked,

243
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,280
You Wiped Out
8 Of My 9 Lives.

244
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
[All Sigh]

245
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800

Extend An Invitation

252
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
To These Trainers
As Well?

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Huh? Huh?
Huh?

256
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,840
Ohh!
Yeow!

257
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Aah! Aah!
Squirt!

258
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,840
Hey, Watch Where
You're Flyin'.

259
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Huh? Somethin' For Me?

260
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,360
Hmm...

261
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,360
Misty: Wow!

262
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,880
Greetings,
Pokemon Trainers.

263
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,360
I Bear An Invitation.

264
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
She's Really Small,
But Really Pretty.

265
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,360
You Have Been Chosen
To Join A Select Group

266
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Of Pokemon Trainers
At A Special Gathering.

267
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,880
It Will Be Hosted
By My Master,

268
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,360
The World's Greatest
Pokemon Trainer,

269
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
At His Palace
On New Island.

270
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
A Chartered Ferry

271
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,360
Will Leave From
Old Shore Wharf

272
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
To Take You To The
Island This Afternoon.

273
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,400
Only Trainers Who

274
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Will Be Admitted.

275
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,400
If You Decide To Attend,
You Must Reply At Once.

276
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
My Master Awaits You.

277
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Uh, Is There
A Rewind Button?

278
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,880
Should We Go?

279
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,160
Of Course We Should!

280
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,400
I've Gotta Meet Her!

281
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,920
I Guess The World's
Number One Trainer

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Wants To Challenge

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Pika.

284
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,400
Hmm? Well, We've Gotta
Let 'Em Know Right Away.

285
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I'm Sayin' Yes.

286
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,680
Pika?

287
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,920
Toge.

288
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,920
[Grunts]

289
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
We Wanna Know
What's So Special

290
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,920
About The Twerp Trio's
Special Delivery!

291
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,920
Hey, Look!

292
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
"Yes"? To What?

293
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Mew.

294
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,920
[Togepi Squeaks]

295
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,160
Pika. Pika. Pi.

296
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,680
Raticate!

297
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,160
Chill Out, Raticate!

298
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Kingler!
Save Your Energy, Will Ya?

299
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,680
This Is Gonna Be
So Cool.

300
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
P.A.: Officer Jenny,

301
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Please Report
To The Ferry Entrance.

302
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Officer Jenny,

303
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,680
To The Ferry Entrance,
Please.

304
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,680
Togepi's
Totally Soaked.

305
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,200
I Can't Believe How Fast
The Storm Came Up.

306
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
Aah!

307
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Huh?
What?

308
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,680
The Ferry Is
Canceled?

309
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,720
But I've Got To Get
To New Island.

310
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Yeah, So Do I.

311
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
What's The Big Deal?

312
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
It's Only
A Little Rain.

313
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
It's More
Than Just Rain.

314
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,200
The Harbor Manager

315
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,200
Thinks This Could Be
The Worst Storm Ever.

316
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,720
Listen To Me.

317
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,200
The Prophets Have Predicted

318
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,720
The Return Of
The Winds Of Water.

319
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,200
For Years, I Have Prayed

320
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,480
That Mankind
Would Never Witness

321
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,840
That Deadly Storm
Ever Again.

322
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
Isn't That
Just A Legend?

323
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,720
The Ancient Writings
Tell Of The Storm

324
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Wiping Out All
But A Few Pokemon.

325
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,480
In Their Sorrow,
The Water Of Their Tears

326
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,240
Somehow Restored The Lives
Lost In The Storm.

327
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
But There Are
No Pokemon Tears Today.

328
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Just Waters Which
No One Can Survive.

329
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,240
And That's Why
Your Ferry

330
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,720
To New Island's
Been Canceled.

331
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
Well, I'm Going To
New Island Anyway.

332
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,760
All My Pokemon
Are Water-Type.

333
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,760
No Fair.

334
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
We'll Just Swim Over
To That Palace.

335
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
I Warn You,
The Waves Will Be Savage.

336
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
You Will Never Make It.

337
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
And Besides,
If You Tried That Stunt

338
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,520
And Your Pokemon Got Hurt,
You'd Be Out Of Luck,

339
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,760
Because We Had To Close Down
The Pokemon Center.

340
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Uh, How Come?

341
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,280
Because The Nurse
In Charge Of The Center

342
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,760
Disappeared Last Month.

343
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,280
And If Any Of You See Her,
Please Contact Me At Once.

344
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,760
That's A Picture Of Her
Over There On The Wall.

345
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,960
Mmm. She's Cute.
Huh.

346
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,160
She Sure
Looks Familiar.

347
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Aah! Aah!

348
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,640
[Roars]

349
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
Aah!

350
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,680
Come Back Here!

351
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,680
Or I'll Place You
Under Arrest!

352
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,160
Dewgong-Gong.

353
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,680
Come Back! Aah!

354
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Some Trainers
Have No Fear.

355
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Huh?

356
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,680
To Them, This Is Just
One More Challenge.

357
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
They Follow
Their Hearts.

358
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,160
That Is What
Sets Them Apart

359
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,200
And Will Make Them
Pokemon Masters.

360
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Good Luck To All Of You.

361
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
The World's Greatest
Pokemon Master

362
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,680
Is Waiting For Me.

363
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,200
Let's Use Our Pokemon
To Get To That Island.

364
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Pika!

365
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,440
Ash, Our Pokemon
Aren't Strong Enough.

366
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,720
They Can't Handle
Giant Waves Like This.

367
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720

553
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Uhh! Gyarados,
Hyperbeam Attack!

554
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
[Roars]

555
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Eee!

556
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,480
Gyarados!

557
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,480
Both: Child's Play.

558
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,000
Your Usefulness
Has Ended.

559
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,480
Huh?

560
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,000
Ohh. Ohh.

561
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,240
Nurse Joy!

562
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,000
Where Am I?

563
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,280
And How In The World
Did I Get Here?

564
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,520
Mewtwo: You Have Been
Under My Control.

565
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,520
I Transported You Here
From The Pokemon Center.

566
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,520
Your Knowledge
Of Pokemon Physiology

567
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,040
Proved Useful For My Plan.

568
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,520
And Now I Have Cleansed
Your Tiny Human Brain

569
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,040
Of Memories
From The Past Few Weeks.

570
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Who Are You?!

571
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,520
I Am The New Ruler
Of This World,

572
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,040
The Master Of Humans
And Pokemon Alike.

573
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,520
You're Just A Bully!

574
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Pika!

575
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,040
Hmm?

576
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
Hmm?
Hmm?

577
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Huh? Hmm?
Huh?

578
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Hmm?

579
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Hmm?
Hmm?

[All Gasp]

581
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,560
Look At These.

582
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,840
They're Pokemon.

583
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,080
Are They Real?

584
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,080
Hmm.

585
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,080
[Sighs]

586
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
I Was Hoping
There'd Be A Party.

587
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,080
Hmph.

588
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,080
Huh?

589
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,080
[All Gasp]

592
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Pokemon Based On
Genetic Analysis.

Pokemon
Dna Sampling Sequence

594
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,120
Now In Progress.

595
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,360
Huhh! Hey, Put Me Down!

596
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,120
What Are Ya-- Let Go!
Uhh!

597
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,120
Help!

598
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,120
Grab Him!

599
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
Help Me!

[All Grunting]

601
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,120
Yee-Yeow!

602
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,640
Aah!

603
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,120
I Made It,
But Just By A Hair.

604
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,640
Jessie: Look,
There's Your Hair.

605
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,640
Computer: Analyzing Pokemon
Biomaterial Sample.

606
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,400
Analysis Complete.

607
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,120
Pokemon Identified.

608
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,640
Begin Replication Sequence.

609
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,120
James: Who's
That Pokemon?

610
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,640
It's Meowth.

611
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Aah!
Huh?

612
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,400
Meowth! Meowth!

613
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,640
Buti'mmeowth.

614
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,160
So's The One
In The Tank.

615
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,640
That's Your Clone.

616
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,160
Huh?

617
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,640

I Haven't Got Much Time.

618
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
[Scientists Screaming]

619
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,680
I Pray This Record Of
Our Experiment Survives.

620
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,680
A Year Ago, We Discovered
A Fossil That Proved To Be

621
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,160
The Remains Of
The Ancient Pokemon, Mew.

622
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Huh? Huh?
Huh?

623
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,680
There Was Sufficient Genetic
Material To Replicate Mew,

624
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,680
But Giovanni,
Who Funded Our Project,

625
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,920
Insisted We Try To Design
Superclones

626
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,160
More Powerful
Than Any Living Pokemon.

627
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,160
Many Attempts Failed,

628
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,680
But Finally Our Experiments
Proved Successful.

629
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,200
We Produced
A Living Pokemon.

630
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,680
We Called It Mewtwo.

631
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,680
But For Some Reason,

632
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
The Creature's Anger
Is Out Of Control.

633
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,160
With Its Psychic Powers,

634
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,160
It Is Destroying
Our Laboratory.

635
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,680
We Dreamed Of Creating
The World's Strongest Pokemon...

636
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,200
And We Succeeded.

637
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,720
Sounds Like
A Real Pokenstein.

638
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,440
Sure Does.

639
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,160
One Bad Cat.

640
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,720
So This Must Be
The Lab.

641
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,680
But If Mewtwo
Destroyed It...

642
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,160
Somebody
Rebuilt It.

643
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,680
Yes. But Who?

644
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
Hmm. Hmm.
Hmm.

645
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,400
Mewtwo: You Humans Are
A Dangerous Species.

646
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,880
You Brought Me
Into Your World

647
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,880
With No Purpose
But To Be Your Slave.

648
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,880
But Now
I Have My Own Purpose.

649
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,440
My Storm Will Create
My Own World...

650
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,640
By Destroying Yours.

651
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,880
So You Hate
All Humans,

652
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,920
And You're Gonna
Destroy Us

653
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
To Save Pokemon.

654
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,920
No. Your Pokemon
Will Not Be Spared.

655
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,440
They Have Disgraced
Themselves

656
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,400
By Serving Humans.

657
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,960
Those Pokemon Are Nothing
But Slaves.

658
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,920
Pika. Pika Pika.

659
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,400
So...

660
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,920
You Say I Am Wrong?

661
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,480
That You Are Not
This Human's Servant,

662
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,920
You Are His Friend?

663
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,960
Pika.

664
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,440
You Are As Pathetic
As The Rest.

665
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,480
Pika.

666
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,440

667
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,680
Pika!

668
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,920
Uhh!

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Aah! Pika-Pi.

671
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,440
Humans And Pokemon

672
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,920
Can Never Be Friends.

673
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,920
Ash...

674
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,440
Are You Ok?

675
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Don't Pick On Pikachu.

676
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,440
If You Are Pokemon,

677
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,960
There's No Reason
I Can't Capture You.

678
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
Go, Rhyhorn.

00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Ohh!

00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
No! Rhyhorn!

Mewtwo: Fools.

683
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Your Pokemon Attacks
Cannot Weaken Me.

684
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,480
My Powers Are Too Great.

685
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,480
No Trainer Can Conquer Me.

686
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,000
Then You Won't Mind
Proving It

687
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,480
In A Real Match.

688
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,000
Is That A Challenge?

689
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,480
You Bet It Is.

690
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480

00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,040
Hmm?

00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
James:
I'm Scared.

701
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
Jessie: Me, Too.

702
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560

703
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,560
Mewtwo: Like Most
Pokemon Trainers,

704
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,080
I, Too, Began
With Charmander,

705
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
Squirtle,
And Bulbasaur.

706
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,560
But For Their Evolved Forms,

707
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,560
I Used Their
Genetic Material

708
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,080
To Clone Even More
Powerful Copies.

709
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
Copies.

710
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,560
They're Clones.

00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,120
Mewtwo Planned This
All Along.

717
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,600
Your Fake Venusaur
Can't Beat My Real One!

718
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,600
Right, Bruteroot?

719

A Nickname,

Will Oppose Me First?

But That Won't
Happen Again.

735
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,480
Go, Bruteroot!

736
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,000

Are You Ok?

01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,840
We Got To Stop This.

1121
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,840
But How?

1122
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,840
All Mewtwo Cares About

1123
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,840
Is Proving How Strong
Those Superclones Are.

1124
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,840
I'd Rather Risk My Life
Out In Mewtwo's Storm

1125
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,840
Than Watch These Pokemon
Destroy Each Other.

1126
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,840
Oh, Me, Too.

1127
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,840
I Wish There Was
Some Way To Stop Them.

They'll Ever Stop.

1131
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,880
Those Pokemon
Look Like They're Ready

1132
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,880
To Fight To The Death.

1133
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,360
That's A Fight That
Nobody's Going To Win.

1134
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,880
Someone's
Got To Take A Stand.

1135
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,880
Someone's Got To Say No

1136
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,120
And Refuse To Fight,

1137
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,360
Just Like Pikachu.

I Thought I Saw
Another One.

Well, Maybe You're
Just Seeing Things, Ash.
