15
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:35,474
Night, Peridot.

16
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,349
Nothing left to do but dream.

17
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:45,060
Hmm.

18
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:48,763
Steven!

19
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:51,958
Steven!

20
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:54,278
Ste... ven!

21
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:56,856
Ronaldo,
it's the middle of the night.

22
00:00:57,034 --> 00:00:59,208
You have to come
to the lighthouse.

23
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:01,856
I've found
something weird.

24
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:03,708
You've found something
weird every day

25
00:01:03,782 --> 00:01:05,700
since my dad got you
that telescope.

26
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:07,200
I know. I'm amazing.

27
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:10,099
You won't believe
my latest discovery.

28
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:12,856
There's something
on the moon.

29
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:14,909
Can't you call Nanefua?

30
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:17,505
Not a fourth time.

31
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,708
Hmm.

32
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:25,685
This is the moon base.
It's always been there.

33
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,442
You have a moon base?!

34
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,770
I have so many questions.

35
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:33,192
One... Why didn't you tell me
about your moon base?

36
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:34,981
Two...
Take me to your moon base.

37
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:37,388
Three... Why does it
look like a barn?

38
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:39,185
It doesn't look like a...

39
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:41,380
Wait, what?

40
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,025
Lapis?

41
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:51,296
Whoa!

42
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,497
Thanks, Lion.

43
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:55,013
That super warp takes
a lot out of you, huh?

44
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,208
You and me both,
buddy.

45
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:01,567
You stay here and rest up,
okay?

46
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:19,192
Why would Lapis bring
the Barn to the moon?

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,091
Thought she wanted to get as far
away from Earth as possible.

48
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:31,817
Lapis?

49
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:34,388
Lapis Lazuli?

50
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:36,333
This is weird.

51
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:40,700
All the meep morps
are still here, but no Lapis.

52
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:48,333
Now, what is going on?

53
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,758
Lapis?

54
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:06,864
Lapis!

55
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,856
Steven.

56
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,208
Hup!

57
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,456
I can't believe it.

58
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,278
It's so good
to see you again.

59
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:16,191
Oh, really?

60
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:17,528
What's going on?

61
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:20,317
I-I thought you'd be halfway
across the galaxy by now.

62
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,747
Aren't you worried about
the Diamonds coming to attack?

63
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:25,536
I got... distracted.

64
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:29,220
By this orb thing?
What is it?

65
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:30,906
Promise
you won't judge me.

66
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:33,661
I sleep with a teddy bear.
No judgments.

67
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,200
Wha...

68
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:43,330
Wha-huh?

69
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:44,528
Beach City?

70
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,466
Please explain this to me.

71
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:49,372
This orb is
an observation device.

72
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:51,630
The Diamonds use them
to watch activity

73
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,981
on their colonies
from afar.

74
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:56,764
- Wow.
- Can I try?

75
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:58,006
Sure.

76
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,506
Whoa.

77
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:04,357
But, Lapis, what are
you using it for?

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,389
You're spying on us?

79
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,777
Well, I wouldn't
call it spying

80
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,545
because that would
make me feel bad.

81
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:36,295
Oh, Lapis.

82
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:38,967
I couldn't stand not knowing
what was going on.

83
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,904
I'm still terrified of
the Diamonds coming to Earth,

84
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:46,514
but I got just outside the
Milky Way and I felt so lonely.

85
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:48,852
So why didn't you
just come back?

86
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:53,737
I want to, but I just can't,
not after the way I left.

87
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,857
What would Peridot say?

88
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:59,442
What if the Diamonds show up?
What if something bad happens?

89
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:02,514
Well, what if
something good happens?

90
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:08,904
Uh, Lapis?

91
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:10,794

I might have overreacted

00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,145
You really think
they're coming?

112
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:57,208
I don't even know anymore.

113
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:59,528
I've done so much
because I was afraid.

114
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:01,536
I left Peridot behind.

115
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:04,167
I took the Barn
and her morps.

116
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:06,184
Hey,
at least she has Pumpkin.

117
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:10,718
I was so sure the Diamonds
would destroy my new home

118
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:12,709
that I did it myself.

119
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,755
It's like I'm back
inside the mirror,

120
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:17,497
except I put myself here.

121
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:20,051
Oh, the moon's not so bad.

122
00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:22,497
Are you kidding?
The moon sucks.

123
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:24,687
There's nothing here.

124
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:27,020
Maybe I'm tired
of running away.

125
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:28,952
Maybe I'd rather
be with everyone

126
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,497
and be in danger
than be safe and alone.

127
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:34,708
They'd be glad
to have you back.

128
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,249
I don't know.
If I went back now,

129
00:07:37,364 --> 00:07:40,336
there's no way things
could go back to how they were.

130
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:42,867
Yeah,
but that's all right.

131
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:44,700
Things would just
be different.

132
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:45,971
What do you mean?

133
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,202
Well, what if you weren't
way out in the country?

134
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:50,892
You could drop the Barn
on the beach.

135
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,475
Then we'd all
be neighbors.

136
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:54,522
I'd come over to borrow
a cup of a sugar

137
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:57,538
and you'd be like,
"What's that?"

138
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:06,545
When you go back,
we should all hang out more.

139
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:11,249
Huh,<i> when</i> I go back.

140
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:17,741
This is what you wanted.

141
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:18,995
Lapis?

142
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:21,499
You begged us for
a colony of your own,

143
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:23,991
and now all you want
to do is be rid of it.

144
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:26,149
First there were
too many Organics.

145
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:28,694
Then their cities were
too difficult to dismantle,

146
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:31,116
and...
And now these Crystal Gems.

147
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:33,475
We're tired of
your excuses, Pink.

148
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:35,147
The Diamonds!

149
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,069
This Rose Quartz
can't hurt you.

150
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:40,999
You can't be swayed
by a few unruly Gems.

151
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,663
Enough.

152
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:47,203
You must understand,
you are a Diamond.

153
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:50,311
Everyone on this planet
is looking to you.

154
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,249
You don't even
have to do anything.

155
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:53,850
Just smile and wave.

156
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:58,577
Show everyone you're unfazed
by this little uprising.

157
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,702
Your gems will fall into line,

158
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:04,420
and these Crystal Gems
will be no more.

159
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:06,649
As long as you
are there to rule,

160
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:09,475
this colony will be completed.

161
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:32,360
Mom's sword?

162
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:33,938
Is that...

163
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:35,681
Pearl?

164
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:40,142
Steven, are you okay?

165
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:41,354
Were you dreaming?

166
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:44,009
I... I saw the Diamonds.

167
00:09:44,212 --> 00:09:46,493
What? What are you
talking about?

168
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:49,454
I dreamt about them.
They were right in this room.

169
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,949
What does that mean?

170
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:52,050
Are they coming?

171
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:54,391
I... I don't know.

172
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,125
What if they are?
What if they're close?

173
00:09:57,282 --> 00:09:58,856
Why else would you see them?

174
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:00,196
Steven.

175
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:05,048
Ugh!

176
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:07,818
Lapis, hold on!

177
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:13,148
Ah!
Ahhh!

178
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:16,350
Where are you going?

179
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,430
As far from Earth
as I can!

180
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:19,896
I'm leaving.

181
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,992
You should be used
to that by now.

182
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:24,010
You don't have to run,
Lapis.

183
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:25,703
Just...
Just stay with us.

184
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,252
I don't know
what I was thinking.

185
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,078
I-I'm not like you
and your friends, Steven.

186
00:10:30,258 --> 00:10:33,078
I can't just let go
of what happened to me.

187
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,023
I can't go through that
again.

188
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,281
Would you rather
be alone?

189
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,771
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:43,664
Wait!

191
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:11,781
Lion, I need you to
take me to Pearl.
