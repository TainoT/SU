1
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:14,361
Dougal,

2
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:17,138
settle down now, please.

3
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:19,721
It won't be long.

4
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:39,076
Next.

5
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,642
British?

6
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:47,979
Yes.

7
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:49,653
First trip to New York?

8
00:02:49,678 --> 00:02:50,232
Yes.

9
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,552
Anything edible in there?

10
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,091
No.

11
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:56,925
Livestock?

12
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,705
Must get that fixed.

13
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,167
No.

14
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,362
Let me take a look.

15
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,299
Welcome to New York.

16
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:33,513
Thank you.

17
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,880
Next.

18
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,969
And it was like a... Like a wind.

19
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,809
Or like a... Like a ghost.

20
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,015
But dark.

21
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,064
And I saw its eyes.

22
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,194
Shining white eyes.

23
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,157
A dark wind, with eyes?

24
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,992
It's like a dark mass.

25
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,488
And it dove down there.
Down underground.

26
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,332
Someone ought to do something about it.

27
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:09,793
It's everywhere, this thing.
It's out of control.

28
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:12,287
Hey,

29
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:14,312
you get anything?

30
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:16,527
Dark wind. Blah, blah.

31
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,936
Some sorta atmospheric hooey.
Or electrical.

32
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,215
Hey, you thirsty?

33
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,008
No. I'm on the wagon.

34
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,967
Promised Martha I'd lay off.

35
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:30,917
It's atmospheric.

36
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,426
Out of the way, folks.

37
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:10,644
Coming through!

38
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:15,395
This great city sparkles
with the jewels of man's inventions.

39
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,896
Movie theaters, automobiles,

40
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,659
the wireless, electric lights,

41
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,243
all dazzle and bewitch us.
I'm so sorry.

42
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:27,582
But where there is light,
there is shadow, friend.

43
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,496
Something is stalking our city,

44
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,210
wreaking destruction and then
disappearing without a trace!

45
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,234
Listen to me.

46
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,291
We have to fight.

47
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:42,508
Join us, the Second Salemers, in our fight.

48
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:45,307
Excuse me doll, just trying to get to the bank.
You hear me?

49
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:46,680
We have to fight together,
Excuse me.

50
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:47,968
For the sake of our...

51
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:49,271
Hey! Watch it!

52
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,444
So sorry. My case.

53
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,015
No harm done.

54
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,149
Excuse me.

55
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,525
You!

56
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,067
Friend.

57
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:04,407
What drew you to our meeting today?

58
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:06,873
I was just passing.

59
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,365
Are you a seeker?

60
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:10,615
A seeker after truth?

61
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,415
I'm more of a chaser, really.

62
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,001
Hear my words.

63
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,591
And heed my warning.

64
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,426
And laugh if you dare.

65
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:27,852
Witches live among us.

66
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:31,483
We have to fight together
for the sake of our children.

67
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,442
For the sake of tomorrow.

68
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:34,978
What do you say to that, friend?

69
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:47,157
Excuse me.

70
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,311
Can I help you, sir?

71
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,189
No, I was just... I was just waiting.

72
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:25,946
Hi.

73
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:29,374
What brings you here?

74
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,544
Same as you.

75
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,499
You're here to get a loan
to open up a bakery?

76
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:35,774
Yes.

77
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,835
What are the odds of that?

78
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,252
Well, may the best man win, I guess.
Excuse me.

79
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,549
Hey! Hey, mister!

80
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,103
Hey, mister.

81
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,637
Hey, fella.

82
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,557
Mr. Kowalski,
Mr. Bingley will see you now.

83
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,061
Okay.

84
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,730
Okay.

85
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,132
You're currently working,

86
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:29,684
in a canning factory.

87
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:32,137
That's the best I can do.
I only got back in...

88
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,659
24.

89
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:36,611
Got back?
From Europe, sir.

90
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:40,016
Yeah. I was part
of the expeditionary forces there.

91
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,273
All right.
Mr. Kowalski...

92
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,095
You gotta try the paczkis, okay?

93
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,376
It's my grandmother's recipe.

94
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:20,752
The orange zest just...

95
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,975
Mr. Kowalski.

96
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:26,482
What do you propose
to offer the bank as collateral?

97
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:28,443
Collateral?

98
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:30,108
Collateral.

99
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,452
There are machines now

100
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:37,293
that can produce hundreds
of donuts an hour.

101
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,656
I know. I know. But they're nothing
like what I can do. You...

102
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,170
The bank must be protected, Mr. Kowalski.

103
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:44,836
Good day to you.

104
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,032
Hey! Mr. English Guy!

105
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,819
I think your egg is hatching.

106
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,674
What just happened?

107
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,726
But, excuse me?

108
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,895
I was over there. Came over...

109
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,686
I was over there.

110
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,236
In you hop.
Hello?

111
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:57,704
No.

112
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,117
Everyone settle down.

113
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,076
Stay. Dougal, don't make me come in there.

114
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:05,368
Don't make me come down there.

115
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,206
Absolutely not.

116
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,298
Alohomora.

117
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,849
So you're gonna steal the money?

118
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,933
Petrificus Totalus.

119
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:24,941
Mr. Bingley!

120
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,396
Kowalski.

121
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:35,607
Really?

122
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,339
No. Don't play that.

123
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,761
Look.

124
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:00,595
Oh, no.

125
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,316
No, no, no. Don't...

126
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:04,281
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot!

127
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,019
Right. For the last time,
you pilfering pest,

128
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,050
paws off what doesn't belong to you.

129
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,621
Awfully sorry about that.

130
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,153
What the hell was that?

131
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,118
Nothing that need concern you.

132
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,910
Now, unfortunately,
you have seen far too much.

133
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,787
If you wouldn't mind,
if you just stand there,

134
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:26,504
this'll be over in a jiffy.

135
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:27,664
Sure. Yeah.

136
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:31,876
Sorry.

137
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,006
Bugger.

138
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,048
Who are you?

139
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:56,851
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,217
Who are you?

141
00:12:58,821 --> 00:12:59,991
Newt Scamander. And you are?

142
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:01,495
What's that thing in your case?

143
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:03,528
That's my Niffler.

144
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,165
Say, you've got something on your...

145
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,237
Why in the name of Deliverance Dane
did you let that thing loose?

146
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,124
I didn't mean to.
He's incorrigible, you see.

147
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,285
Anything shiny, he's all over...
You didn't mean to?

148
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,060
No.

149
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:16,672
You could not have chosen
a worse time to let that creature loose.

150
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,339
We're in the middle of a situation here.

151
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:22,777
I'm taking you in.

152
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,385
Taking me in where?

153
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,421
Magical Congress of
the United States of America.

154
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,231
So you work for MACUSA.

155
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,189
What are you, some kind of investigator?

156
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,737
At least tell me
you took care of the No-Maj.

157
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,158
The what?
The No-Maj.

158
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,779
No-Magic. The non-wizard!

159
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,386
Sorry, we call them Muggles.

160
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:50,027
You wiped his memory, right?

161
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,001
The No-Maj with the case?

162
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,456
That's a Section 3-A, Mr. Scamander.

163
00:13:58,756 --> 00:13:59,836
I'm taking you in.

164
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,666
Come on.

165
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,356
Sorry, but I do have things to do, actually.

166
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:17,322
Well...
You'll have to rearrange them.

167
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,154
What are you doin' in New York anyway?

168
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,739
I came to buy a birthday present.

169
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,611
Couldn't you have done that in London?

170
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,275
No, there's only one breeder of
Appaloosa Puffskeins in the world,

171
00:14:27,276 --> 00:14:29,096
and he lives in New York. So, no.

172
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:32,116
I got a Section 3-A.

173
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:35,024
Hey.

174
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:39,086
By the way, we don't allow the breeding
of magical creatures in New York.

175
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:41,585
We closed that guy down a year ago.

176
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:31,811
Hey, Goldstein.

177
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,676
Hey, Red.

178
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,063
Major Investigation Department.

179
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,516
I thought you was...
Major Investigation Department.

180
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:42,937
I got a Section 3-A.

181
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,696
The International Confederation
is threatening to send a delegation.

182
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,575
They think this is related
to Grindelwald's attacks in Europe.

183
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,455
I was there.

184
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,884
This is a beast.

185
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:06,336
No human could do what this thing
is capable of, Madam President.

186
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,049
Whatever it is, one thing is clear.
It must be stopped.

187
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,717
It's terrorizing No-Majs.

188
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,849
And when No-Majs are afraid, they attack.

189
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,191
This could mean exposure.

190
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:18,483
It could mean war.

191
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,370
I made your position here
quite clear, Ms. Goldstein.

192
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,500
Yes, Madam President. But I...
You're no longer an Auror.

193
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,579
No.

194
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:39,779
Madam President, but...
Goldstein.

195
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,132
There's been a minor...

196
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:45,633
This office is currently concerned
with very major incidents. Get out.

197
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:46,798
Yes, ma'am.

198
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,833
So you got your wand permit?

199
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,123
All foreigners have to have them in New York.

200
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,964
I made a postal application weeks ago.

201
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,921
Scamander...

202
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,548
And you were just in Equatorial Guinea?

203
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,384
And I've just completed a year in the fields.

204
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,641
I'm writing a book about magical creatures.

205
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,757
Like an extermination guide?

206
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,219
No, a guide to help people understand

207
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,601
why we should be protecting
these creatures instead of killing them.

208
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,888
Goldstein?

209
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:42,477
Where is she?

210
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,023
Where is she? Goldstein?

211
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:47,442
Goldstein?

212
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,696
Did you just butt in
on the investigative team again?

213
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:57,827
Where have you been?

214
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,162
What?

215
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,618
Where'd she pick you up?

216
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,750
Me?

217
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,665
Have you been tracking
them Second Salemers again?

218
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,423
Of course not, sir.

219
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,046
Afternoon, Mr. Graves, sir.

220
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,139
Afternoon, Abernathy.

221
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,177
Mr. Graves, sir, this is Mr. Scamander.

222
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,929
He has a crazy creature in that case,

223
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,651
and it got out
and caused mayhem in a bank.

224
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,522
Let's see the little guy.

225
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,548
Tina.

226
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,868
I'm sorry, Grandma.

227
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,566

Is it a witch's mark, ma'am?

239
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,373
No.

240
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,502
He's okay.

241
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,384
I can't believe you didn't Obliviate that man.

242
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,351
If there's an inquiry, I'm finished.

243
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,893
Why would you be finished?
I'm the one that's...

244
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,465
I'm not supposed
to go near the Second Salemers.

245
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,364
What was that?

246
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:57,705
Moth, I think.

247
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,967
Big moth.

248
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,674
Hey! Hey! Quiet down!
I'm trying to get a statement.

249
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:07,925
I'm telling you, it's a gas explosion again.

250
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,779
I ain't taking the kids back up there
until it's safe.

251
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,520
Hey, sorry, ma'am.
There ain't no smell of gas.

252
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:14,617
It weren't gas, officer. I seen it.

253
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:17,858
It was a gigantic, huge hippopoto...

254
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:19,359
Gas.

255
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,720
Gas. It was gas!

256
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,710
Mr. Scamander!

257
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,433
It was open?

258
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,693
Just a smidge.

259
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,523
That crazy Niffler thing's on the loose again?

260
00:23:17,555 --> 00:23:18,565
Might be.

261
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,417
Then look for it.

262
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:22,536
Look!

263
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,990
His neck's bleeding.

264
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,530
He's hurt.

265
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,540
Wake up! Mr. No-Maj.

266
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,076
Mercy Lewis, what is that?

267
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:35,961
It's nothing to worry about.

268
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,960
That is...

269
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:39,562
a Murtlap.

270
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,641
What else have you got in there?

271
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:45,424
You?

272
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:46,859
Hello.

273
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,354
Easy, Mr...

274
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,180
Kowalski. Jacob.

275
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,154
You can't Obliviate him.

276
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:53,716
We need him as a witness.

277
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,999
I'm so sorry. You've just yelled at me the length
of New York for not doing it in the first place.

278
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,022
He's hurt! He looks ill.
He'll be fine.

279
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,769
Murtlap bites aren't serious.

280
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,819
Yeah, I admit that is a slightly more
severe reaction than I've seen.

281
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,776
But if it was really serious, he'd have...

282
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,328
What?

283
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,635
Well, the first symptom
would be flames out of his anus.

284
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,997
He doesn't seem to...
This is balled up!

285
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,377
It'll last 48 hours at the most.

286
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,754
I can keep him, if you want me to.
Keep him?

287
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,461
We don't keep them.

288
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:29,301
Mr. Scamander, do you know anything
about the wizarding community in America?

289
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:30,893
I do know a few things, actually.

290
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:34,524
I know that you have rather backwards laws
about relations with Non-Magic people.

291
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,976
That you're not meant to befriend them.

292
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:38,847
That you can't marry them,
which seems mildly absurd to me.

293
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,032
Who's gonna marry him?

294
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,614
You're both coming with me.

295
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,404
I don't see why I need to come with you.

296
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,358
Help me.
I'm dreaming, right?

297
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,568
Yeah.
Please.

298
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,117
I'm tired.
I never went to the bank.

299
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,199
This is all just some big nightmare, right?

300
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,118
For the both of us, Mr. Kowalski.

301
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,438
Hey, you all right there?

302
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,433
And so this is the newsroom.

303
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:56,677
Let's go.

304
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:58,977
Hey, how are you?

305
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,810
Make way for the Barebones.

306
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,358
Now, they're...

307
00:26:04,383 --> 00:26:07,255
just putting the papers to bed, as they say.

308
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,236
Mr. Shaw. Sir. He's with the Senator.

309
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,827
Never mind that, Barker.
I wanna see my father.

310
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,369
I'm so sorry, Mr. Shaw,
but your son insisted.

311
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,749
Father, you're gonna wanna hear this.

312
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:28,709
I've got something huge.

313
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,837
Your brother and I are busy here, Langdon.

314
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:32,339
Working on his election campaign.

315
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:34,089
We don't have time for this.

316
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:38,097
This is Mary Lou Barebone
from the New Salem Preservation Society.

317
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,015
And she's got a big story for you.

318
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,019
Oh, she has, has she?

319
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:45,688
There's strange things
going on all over the city.

320
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,475
The people behind this,
they are not like you and me.

321
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,610
This is witchcraft. Don't you see?

322
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,777
Langdon.
She doesn't want any money.

323
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,965
Then either her story is worthless,
or she's lying about the cost.

324
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:59,118
Nobody gives away anything
valuable for free, Langdon.

325
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,369
You're right, Mr. Shaw.

326
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,827
What we desire is infinitely
more valuable than money.

327
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,541
It's your influence.

328
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,302
Millions of people read your newspapers,

329
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,461
and they need to be made aware
about this danger.

330
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,380
The crazy disturbances in the subway.

331
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,049
Just look at the pictures.

332
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,048
I'd like you and your friends to leave.

333
00:27:17,072 --> 00:27:18,983
No. Look, you're missing a trick here.

334
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,530
Just look at the evidence!

335
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:21,734
Really?

336
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:22,676
Langdon.

337
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:24,755
Listen to Father and just go.

338
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:25,978
And...

339
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:28,614
Take the freaks with you.

340
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,573
This is Father's office, not yours.

341
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,509
And I'm sick of this.
Every time I walk in here...

342
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,720
Okay. That's it!

343
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,817
Thank you.

344
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,237
We hope you'll reconsider, Mr. Shaw.

345
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,542
We're not difficult to find.

346
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,633
Until then...

347
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,922
we thank you for your time.

348
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:01,815
Hey, boy!

349
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,435
You dropped something.

350
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,017
Here you go, freak.

351
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,781
Why don't you put that in the trash
where you all belong?

352
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:25,292
Take a right here.

353
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,090
Okay.

354
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,549
Before we go in...

355
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:40,007
I'm not supposed to have men
on the premises.

356
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,758
In that case, Mr. Kowalski and I can
easily seek other accommodations.

357
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,141
No, you don't.

358
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,178
Watch your step.

359
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,937
That you, Tina?

360
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,695
Yes, Mrs. Esposito.

361
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:58,992
Are you alone?

362
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,951
I'm always alone, Mrs. Esposito.

363
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,760
Teenie,

364
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:18,546
you brought men home.

365
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,927
Gentlemen, this is my sister.

366
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,175
Wanna put something on, Queenie?

367
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:28,847
Oh, sure.

368
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,366
So, who are they?

369
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:48,747
That's Mr. Scamander.

370
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,253
He's committed a serious infraction
of the National Statute of Secrecy.

371
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,031
He's a criminal?

372
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,714
And that's Mr. Kowalski. He's a No-Maj.

373
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:58,717
A No-Maj?

374
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,052
Teen, what are you up to?

375
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:03,597
He's sick. It's a long story.

376
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:08,391
Mr. Scamander has lost something
I'm going to help him find.

378
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:11,104
You need to sit down, honey.

379
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:13,149
He hasn't eaten anything all day.

380
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:14,396
And...

381
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,149
Oh, that's rough.

382
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,820
He didn't get the money
he wanted for his bakery.

383
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,065
You bake, honey?

384
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,735
I love to cook.

385
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,174
You're a Legilimens?

386
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:25,741
Yeah.

387
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,619
But I always have trouble with your kind.
Brits.

388
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,328
It's the accent.

389
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,999
You know how to read minds?

390
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,916
Oh, don't worry, honey.

391
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:38,094
Most guys think what you was thinking
first time they see me.

392
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,925
Now, you need food.

393
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:58,525
Hot dog? Again?
Don't read my mind.

394
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,071
Not a very wholesome lunch.

395
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
Hey, Mr. Scamander.

396
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,713
You prefer pie or strudel?

397
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
I really don't have a preference.

398
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,600
You prefer strudel, huh, honey?

399
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,231
Strudel it is.

400
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,709
Well, sit down, Mr. Scamander.

401
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,667
We're not gonna poison you.

402
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,918
You're upset.

403
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:43,051
It's your mother again.

404
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,719
Somebody said something.

405
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,719
What did they say? Tell me.

406
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:49,586
Do you think I'm a freak?

407
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,721
No. I think you're a very special young man,

408
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:56,019
or I wouldn't have asked you
to help me, now would I?

409
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:01,975
Have you any news?

410
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:04,439
I'm still looking.

412
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,946
Mr. Graves, if I knew
whether it was a girl or a boy...

413
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:14,485
My vision showed
only the child's immense power.

414
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,498
He or she is no older than 10.

415
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,712
I saw this child
in close proximity to your mother.

416
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:24,206
She I saw so plainly.

417
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,167
That could be any one of hundreds...

418
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,089
There's something else.
Something I haven't told you.

419
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,588
I saw you beside me in New York.

420
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:36,138
You're the one who gains this child's trust.

421
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:39,097
You are the key. I saw this.

422
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:42,268
You want to join the wizarding world.

423
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,189
I want those things too, Credence.

424
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:46,778
I want them for you.

425
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:49,902
So find the child.

426
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,782
Find the child and we'll all be free.

427
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,041
The job ain't that glamorous.

428
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,293
I mean, I spend most days making coffee.

429
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:00,995
Unjinxing the john.

430
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,747
Tina's the career girl.

431
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,630
Nah, we're orphans.

432
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:10,126
Ma and Pa died of Dragon Pox
when we were kids.

434
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,136
You're sweet.

435
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,564
But we got each other.

436
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,979
Could you stop
reading my mind for a second?

437
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,980
Don't get me wrong, I love it.

438
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,278
This meal, it's insanely good.

439
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,356
And this is what I do, I'm a cook.

440
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:35,659
And this is like the greatest meal
I have ever had in my life.

441
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:40,966
You slay me.

442
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,000
I ain't never really talked to a No-Maj before.

443
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:46,958
Really?

444
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,513
I am not flirting.

445
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,310
I'm just saying, don't go getting attached.

446
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,400
He's gonna have to be Obliviated.

447
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,055
It's nothing personal.

448
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:09,777
Oh, hey, you okay, honey?

449
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:13,572
So, Ms. Goldstein, I think Mr. Kowalski
could do with an early night.

450
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:17,276
Besides, you and I will need to be up early
tomorrow morning to find my Niffler, so...

451
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:19,866
What's a Niffler?

452
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,408
Don't ask.

453
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:25,041
Hey, you guys can bunk in here.

454
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:44,057
I thought you might like a hot drink.

455
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,239
Hey. Mr. Scamander, look, cocoa.

456
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,248
Toilet's down the hall to the right.

457
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,418
Thanks.

458
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,381
Very much.

459
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,072
Come on.

460
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,379
For the love...

461
00:37:08,144 --> 00:37:09,234
Will you sit down?

462
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:11,758
Good idea.

463
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,279
That's definitely the Murtlap.

464
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:20,406
You must be particularly susceptible.

465
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,742
See, you're a Muggle,

466
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,239
so our physiologies are subtly different.

467
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,143
Stay still.

468
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,012
That should stop the sweating.

469
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:39,974
And one of those should sort the twitch.

470
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,364
Here, take that.

471
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,730
Come on.

472
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,403
Whatcha got there?

473
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:02,199
This, the locals call Swooping Evil.

474
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,700
Not the friendliest of names.

475
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,914
It's quite an agile fella.

476
00:38:10,957 --> 00:38:13,037
I've been studying him, and I'm pretty sure

477
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,749
that his venom could be quite useful
if properly diluted.

478
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,255
Just to remove bad memories, you know?

479
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:28,425
Probably shouldn't let him
loose in here, though.

480
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:31,503
Come on.

481
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,584
Come on. Down you come.

482
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,422
Come on.

483
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:06,095
Thank Paracelsus.

484
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:10,598
If you'd have got out,
that could've been quite catastrophic.

485
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:13,563
So he's the real reason I came to America.

486
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,687
To bring Frank home.

487
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:22,902
Wait. No, sorry. Stay there.

488
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,860
He's a wee bit sensitive to strangers.

489
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,083
Here you are. Here you are.

490
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:30,491
He was trafficked, you see.

491
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:34,004
I found him in Egypt.
He was all chained up.

492
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:37,424
Couldn't leave him there.
I had to bring him back.

493
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:40,253
I'm gonna put you back
where you belong, aren't I, Frank?

494
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,631
To the wilds of Arizona.

495
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:23,875
All right, here they come.

496
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:26,974
Here who comes?

497
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,344
Graphorns.

498
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,005
Hey!
You're all right.

499
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:35,441
Hello.

500
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,193
Hello.

501
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,983
So they're the last
breeding pair in existence.

502
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:44,782
So if I hadn't managed to rescue them,

503
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:47,404
that could've been
the end of Graphorns forever.

504
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:53,655
All right.

505
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,577
What, you rescue these creatures?

506
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:03,591
Yes, that's right.
Rescue, nurture and protect them.

507
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,094
And I'm gently trying to educate
my fellow wizards about them.

508
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,762
Come on.

509
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:21,557
Titus, Finn.

510
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,520
Poppy, Marlow, Tom.

511
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,903
He had a cold.

512
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,700
He needed some body warmth.

513
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:32,912
All right, on you hop.

514
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:38,456
He has some attachment issues.

515
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,920
Now, come on, Pickett.

516
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:43,835
Pickett.

517
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:46,763
No, they're not gonna bully you,
now come on.

518
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:48,798
Pickett.

519
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:50,758
All right.

520
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:55,311
And that is exactly why
they accuse me of favoritism.

521
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,929
Oh, no, Dougal's gone.

522
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,399
All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.

523
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,480
Mum's here. Mum's here.

524
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:04,901
Oh, hello.

525
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:06,859
Let me take a look at you.

526
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:09,606
I know these guys.

527
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:13,573
Your Occamy.

528
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:16,413
What do you mean, my Occamy?
Yes.

529
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:18,453
Do you want to...

530
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,867
Yeah, sure.

531
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:22,502
Okay.

532
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:29,971
Hey.

533
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:33,395
Oh, sorry, no, don't pet him.

534
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,799
They... learn to defend themselves early.

535
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,641
See, their shells are made of silver,
so they're incredibly valuable.

536
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:39,847
Okay.

537
00:42:40,017 --> 00:42:42,187
Their nests tend to get
ransacked by hunters.

538
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:43,806
Thank you.

539
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:46,821
Mr. Scamander?

540
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:48,032
Oh, call me Newt.

541
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:51,031
Newt. I don't think I'm dreaming.

542
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:52,737
What gave it away?

543
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:55,566
I ain't got the brains to make this up.

544
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:02,193
Would you mind throwing some of those
pellets in with the Mooncalfs over there?

545
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:06,001
Yeah, sure.
Just over there's...

546
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,013
Bugger.

547
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:12,757
Niffler's gone.

548
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:14,675
Course he has, little bugger.

549
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,643
Any chance to get his hands
on something shiny.

550
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,890
What did you do today, Jacob?

551
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:58,682
I was inside a suitcase.

552
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:00,216
Hey.

553
00:44:00,723 --> 00:44:01,893
Oh, hello, fellas.

554
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,847
All right. All right.

555
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:06,688
Take it easy. Take it easy.

556
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:16,028
Cutie.

557
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:18,741
There it is.

558
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:05,196
Step back.

559
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:07,498
Step back.

560
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:11,424
What's the matter with this?
I said, step away.

561
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:14,713
What the hell is this thing?

562
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,134
It's an Obscurus.

563
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,550
I need to get going.

564
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:22,222
Find everyone who's escaped,
before they get hurt.

565
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:23,558
Before they get hurt?

566
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:24,812
Yes, Mr. Kowalski.

567
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,773
So they're currently in alien terrain

568
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:29,984
surrounded by millions of the most
vicious creatures on the planet.

569
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:33,654
Humans.

570
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:38,777
So where would you say
that a medium-sized creature

571
00:45:38,946 --> 00:45:40,656
who likes broad open plains,

572
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:42,663
trees, sort of waterholes,
that sort of thing.

573
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,161
Where might she go?

574
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:45,486
In New York City?

575
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:47,826
Yes.
Plains?

576
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,119
Central Park.

577
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:51,879
And where is that exactly?

578
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:53,342
Where is Central Park?

579
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,510
Well, look...

580
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:00,835
I would come and show you,

581
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:02,849
but don't you think it's kind
of a double-cross?

582
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,891
The girls take us in,
they make us hot cocoa...

583
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:07,176
Now you do realize that once they see

584
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,519
that you stopped sweating,
they will Obliviate you in a heartbeat?

585
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:10,885
What's "Bliviate" mean?

586
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:13,611
It'll be like you wake up
and all memory of magic gone.

587
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:19,617
I won't remember any of this?

588
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,080
No.

589
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:27,914
All right, yeah, okay. I'll help you.

590
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:33,878
Come on, then.

591
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:54,229
Credence, where have you been?

592
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:59,942
I was looking for a place
for tomorrow's meeting.

593
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:05,124
There's a corner on 32nd Street that could...

594
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:14,247
I'm sorry, Ma.

595
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,168
I didn't realize it was so late.

596
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,752
I was watching you at dinner.
Yeah.

597
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:15,644
People like you, don't they, Mr. Kowalski?

598
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:20,221
Well, I'm sure people like you, too?

599
00:48:20,582 --> 00:48:22,752
Not really, no. I annoy people.

600
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:27,656
Why did you decide to be a baker?

601
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:29,323
Well...

602
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:30,908
Because I'm dying,

603
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:32,736
in that canning factory.

604
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:36,325
Everyone there's dying.
It just crushes the life out of you.

605
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:38,423
Do you like canned food?
No.

606
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:40,214
Yeah, me neither.

607
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:43,132
That's why I wanna make pastries.
You know, it makes people happy.

608
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:44,627
We're going this way.

609
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:46,679
So did you get your loan?

610
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:48,724
No.

611
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,547
I ain't got no collateral.

612
00:48:50,721 --> 00:48:52,851
Stayed in the army too long, apparently.
I don't know.

613
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:54,465
You fought in the war?

614
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,601
Of course I fought in the war.
Everyone fought in the war.

615
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:59,348
You didn't fight in the war?
I worked mostly with dragons.

616
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:00,691
Ukrainian Ironbellies.

617
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,516
Eastern Front.

618
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,263
Fenestra.

619
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:37,294
Accio.

620
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:59,037
All right. Happy?

621
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:03,270
One down, two to go.

622
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:15,217
They went that way, officer.

623
00:51:15,923 --> 00:51:17,603
Hands up.

624
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:22,663
What the hell is that?

625
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:26,964
Lion.

626
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:37,506
You know,

627
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:41,271
New York is considerably
more interesting than I'd expected.

628
00:51:57,491 --> 00:51:58,771
Put this on.

629
00:51:59,493 --> 00:52:02,353
But why would I have to wear
something like this?

630
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:05,831
Because your skull is susceptible
to breakage under immense force.

631
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:28,444
But we made them cocoa.

632
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:32,441
All right.

633
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:38,407
Here, you just, pop this on.

634
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:40,576
Okay.

635
00:52:40,742 --> 00:52:43,792
Now there's absolutely
nothing for you to worry about.

636
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:47,292
Tell me, has anyone ever believed you
when you told them not to worry?

637
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:50,587
Well, my philosophy is that
worrying means you suffer twice.

638
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:57,434
She's in season.

639
00:52:57,926 --> 00:52:59,966
She needs to mate.

640
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:06,944
Erumpent musk. She's mad for it.

641
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:17,052
Good girl.

642
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:19,802
Come on.

643
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:21,256
Into the case.

644
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:32,519
Get!

645
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:39,993
Oh, no.

646
00:55:08,515 --> 00:55:09,595
Reparo.

647
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:13,517
Merlin's beard!

648
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:19,688
Tree!

649
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:21,743
They're exactly the same.

650
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:24,488
Same thing.

651
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:25,831
Newt!

652
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:31,495
No, don't.

653
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:34,372
I'm so sorry.

654
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:35,022
Good show, Mr. Kowalski.

655
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,022
Call me Jacob.

656
00:56:47,614 --> 00:56:48,407
Well...

657
00:56:49,132 --> 00:56:50,709
Two down, one to go.

658
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:56,868
In you hop.

659
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:14,471
Ladies and gentlemen...

660
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:17,771
Tonight's keynote speaker

661
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,020
needs no introduction from me.

662
00:57:21,523 --> 00:57:24,113
He's been mentioned as a future president.

663
00:57:25,527 --> 00:57:27,117
And if you don't believe me,

664
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:29,017
just read his daddy's newspapers.

665
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:33,946
Ladies and gentlemen,

666
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:36,099
I give you the senator for New York...

667
00:57:36,524 --> 00:57:37,983
Henry Shaw.

668
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:44,753
Thank you.

669
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:47,256
Thank you.

670
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:53,011
Thank you.

671
00:58:17,871 --> 00:58:19,081
And it's true,

672
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:21,535
we have made some progress.

673
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:25,254
But there is no reward for idleness.

674
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,528
So just as the odious saloons,

675
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:30,144
have been banished.

676
00:58:44,314 --> 00:58:47,154
So now the pool halls,

677
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,855
and these private parlors...

678
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:02,915
What is that?

679
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:21,114
No! No!

680
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:54,878
Witches.

681
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:06,438
Our American friends
have permitted a breach

682
01:00:07,063 --> 01:00:11,483
of the Statute of Secrecy that
threatens to expose us all.

683
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:13,335
I will not be lectured by the man

684
01:00:13,336 --> 01:00:15,546
who let Gellert Grindelwald
slip through his fingers.

685
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:19,283
Madam President, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but this is critical...

686
01:00:33,006 --> 01:00:34,956
You better have an excellent excuse,

687
01:00:34,957 --> 01:00:36,957
for this intrusion, Ms. Goldstein.

688
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:39,552
Yes. I do.

689
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:43,724
Ma'am,

690
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:47,497
yesterday a wizard entered
New York with a case,

691
01:00:47,922 --> 01:00:50,463
this case full of magical creatures.

692
01:00:50,464 --> 01:00:52,314
And unfortunately, some have escaped.

693
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:54,147
He arrived yesterday?

694
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:57,678
You've known for 24 hours,

695
01:00:57,947 --> 01:00:59,961
that an unregistered wizard set

696
01:01:00,286 --> 01:01:04,855
magical beasts loose in New York and you see
fit to tell us only when a man has been killed?

697
01:01:07,332 --> 01:01:08,462
Who's been killed?

698
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:10,783
Where is this man?

699
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:52,449
Scamander?

700
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:56,336
Hello, Minister.

701
01:01:56,506 --> 01:01:57,626
Theseus Scamander?

702
01:01:57,999 --> 01:01:59,169
The war hero?

703
01:01:59,233 --> 01:02:01,113
No. This is his little brother.

704
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:03,676
And what are you doing in New York?

705
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:05,905
I came to buy an Appaloosa Puffskein, sir.

706
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:06,973
Right.

707
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,810
What are you really doing here?

708
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:11,439
Goldstein,

709
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:12,807
who is this?

710
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:15,582
This is Jacob Kowalski, Madam President.

711
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:18,273
He's a No-Maj who got bitten
by one of Mr. Scamander's creatures.

712
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:20,491
No-Maj? Obliviate him.

713
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:22,017
Obliviate him.

714
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:27,157
Merlin's beard.

715
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:31,503
You know which of your creatures
was responsible, Mr. Scamander?

716
01:02:36,504 --> 01:02:38,054
No creature did this.

717
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,660
Don't pretend.

718
01:02:41,509 --> 01:02:43,529
You must know what that was.
Look at the marks.

719
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:49,777
That was an Obscurus.

720
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:54,904
You go too far, Mr. Scamander.

721
01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:58,362
There is no Obscurial in America.

722
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:03,059
Impound that case, Graves.

723
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:05,536
Wait, no. Give that back.
Arrest them.

724
01:03:10,872 --> 01:03:12,542
Don't hurt those creatures.

725
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:15,537
Please. You don't understand.
Nothing in there's dangerous.

726
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:16,678
Nothing.

727
01:03:16,678 --> 01:03:18,105
We'll be the judges of that.

728
01:03:18,379 --> 01:03:19,909
Take them to the cells.

729
01:03:20,882 --> 01:03:23,972
Don't hurt those creatures.
Nothing in there is dangerous.

730
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:26,549
Please don't hurt my creatures.
They aren't dangerous!

731
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:28,636
Please! They're not dangerous!

732
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:30,770
They're not dangerous!

733
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:41,529
I'm so sorry about your creatures,
Mr. Scamander.

734
01:03:42,445 --> 01:03:43,855
I truly am.

735
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:50,078
Can someone please tell me what this
Obscurial, Obscurius thing is, please?

736
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:54,421
There hasn't been one for centuries.

737
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:58,793
I met one in Sudan three months ago.

738
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:03,836
There used to be more of them,
but they still exist.

739
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:09,426
It was before wizards went underground,

740
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:13,096
when we were still
being hunted by Muggles.

741
01:04:14,227 --> 01:04:17,897
Young wizards and witches
sometimes tried to suppress their magic

742
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:19,614
to avoid persecution.

743
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:24,610
So, instead of learning to harness
or to control their powers,

744
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:28,948
they developed
what was called an Obscurus.

745
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:36,230
It's an unstable, uncontrollable dark
force that busts out and attacks.

746
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:41,335
And then vanishes.

747
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:47,335
Obscurials can't survive long, can they?

748
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:51,805
There's no documented case of an Obscurial
surviving past the age of 10.

749
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,732
The one I met in Africa was 8 when she...

750
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:02,147
She was 8 when she died.

751
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:06,993
What are you telling me here?

752
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:10,754
That Senator Shaw was killed by a kid?

753
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:19,829

754
01:05:20,001 --> 01:05:23,501

758
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:35,729
Hand out your leaflets.

759
01:05:36,726 --> 01:05:38,186
I'll know if you dump them.

760
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:41,563
Tell me if you see anything suspicious.

761
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:13,719
It was good to make
your acquaintance, Jacob.

762
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:16,063
And I hope you get your bakery.

763
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,310
You're an interesting man, Mr. Scamander.

764
01:06:29,478 --> 01:06:30,598
Mr. Graves.

765
01:06:39,664 --> 01:06:42,849
You were thrown out of Hogwarts
for endangering human life.

766
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:44,220
That was an accident.

767
01:06:44,244 --> 01:06:45,510
With a beast.

768
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:49,993
Yet one of your teachers argued
strongly against your expulsion. Now...

769
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:54,751
what makes Albus Dumbledore,

770
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:57,176
so fond of you?

771
01:07:02,228 --> 01:07:03,688
I really couldn't say.

772
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:06,944
So setting a pack
of dangerous creatures loose here was...

773
01:07:10,403 --> 01:07:12,913
just another accident. Is that right?

774
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:15,074
Why would I do it deliberately?

775
01:07:15,441 --> 01:07:17,141
To expose wizardkind.

776
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:21,122
To provoke war between
the magical and non-magical worlds.

777
01:07:21,956 --> 01:07:24,826
Mass slaughter for the greater good, you mean?

778
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:28,461
Yes.

779
01:07:29,714 --> 01:07:30,724
Quite.

780
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:35,136
I'm not one of Grindelwald's fanatics,
Mr. Graves.

781
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,236
I wonder what you can tell me about this...

782
01:07:42,361 --> 01:07:43,484
Mr. Scamander.

783
01:07:57,742 --> 01:07:59,372
It's an Obscurus.

784
01:07:59,994 --> 01:08:01,164
But it's not what you think.

785
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:04,496
So I managed to separate it from the
Sudanese girl as I tried to save her.

786
01:08:04,765 --> 01:08:06,725
So I wanted to take it home to study it.

787
01:08:06,892 --> 01:08:08,312
But it cannot survive outside that.

788
01:08:08,377 --> 01:08:10,167
It could not hurt anyone, Tina.

789
01:08:10,463 --> 01:08:12,203
So it's useless without the host?

790
01:08:13,174 --> 01:08:14,514
Useless?

791
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:17,176
Useless?

792
01:08:19,722 --> 01:08:23,892
That is a parasitical,
magical force that killed a child.

793
01:08:24,059 --> 01:08:26,149
What on earth would you use it for?

794
01:08:32,777 --> 01:08:34,697
You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.

795
01:08:34,862 --> 01:08:37,196
You brought this Obscurus
into the City of New York

796
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:38,717
in the hope of causing mass disruption,

797
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,663
breaking the Statute of Secrecy
and revealing the magical world.

798
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,461
You know that can't hurt anyone.
You know that.

799
01:08:43,462 --> 01:08:44,932
You are therefore guilty
of a treasonous betrayal

800
01:08:44,997 --> 01:08:47,137
of your fellow wizards
and are sentenced to death.

801
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,740
Miss Goldstein, who has aided and abetted you.

802
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:51,310
No, she's done nothing of the kind.

803
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:53,208
She receives the same sentence.

804
01:08:55,391 --> 01:08:56,931
Just do it immediately.

805
01:08:57,092 --> 01:08:59,262
I will inform President Picquery myself.
Tina.

806
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:02,514
Please.

807
01:09:16,237 --> 01:09:18,907
Don't do this, Bernadette. Please.

808
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:21,744
It don't hurt.

809
01:09:58,904 --> 01:09:59,954
<i>Tina.</i>

810
01:10:00,114 --> 01:10:01,204
<i>Momma?</i>

811
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:03,741
<i>Tina.</i>

812
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:07,866
<i>Come on, pumpkin. Time for bed.</i>

813
01:10:08,581 --> 01:10:09,961
<i>Are you ready?</i>

814
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:12,786
Don't that look good?

815
01:10:17,298 --> 01:10:18,568
You wanna get in?

816
01:10:27,808 --> 01:10:28,928
Hey, Sam.

817
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:30,691
Hey, Queenie.
They need you downstairs.

818
01:10:30,853 --> 01:10:32,063
I'll Obliviate this guy.

819
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:33,609
You ain't qualified.

820
01:10:35,316 --> 01:10:36,426
Hey, Sam.

821
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:38,857
Does Cecily know you been seeing Ruby?

822
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:43,189
How did you...
Let me Obliviate this guy,

823
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:44,700
and she'll never hear about it from me.

824
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:49,999
What are you doing?

825
01:10:51,364 --> 01:10:52,974
Teen's in trouble.
I'm trying to listen.

826
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,380
Jacob, where's Newt's case?

827
01:10:54,543 --> 01:10:56,363
I think that guy Graves took it.

828
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:58,377
Okay. Come on.

829
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:00,337
What, you're not gonna Obliviate me?

830
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:04,038
Of course not. You're one of us now.

831
01:11:09,141 --> 01:11:10,771
<i>Tina.</i>

832
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:33,924
<i>It's okay.</i>

833
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:45,007
Alohomora.

834
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,060
Aberto.

835
01:11:50,224 --> 01:11:52,394
He would know
some fancy spell to lock his office.

836
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:58,611
Okay, let's get the good stuff outta you.

837
01:12:18,711 --> 01:12:20,001
<i>Witch!</i>

838
01:12:30,097 --> 01:12:32,267
Mr. Scamander!

839
01:12:32,808 --> 01:12:33,998
Don't panic.

840
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:35,891
What do you suggest I do instead?

841
01:12:41,316 --> 01:12:42,396
Jump.

842
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,240
Are you crazy?

843
01:12:47,031 --> 01:12:48,241
Jump on him.

844
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:52,751
Tina, listen to me.

845
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,460
I'll catch you.

846
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:56,752
Tina.

847
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:04,211
I'll catch you.

848
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:06,839
I've got you, Tina.

849
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,340
Go!

850
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:15,391
Come on.

851
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,660
Leave his brains. Come on. Come on!

852
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:41,836
What is that thing?

853
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:43,092
Swooping Evil.

854
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:44,683
Well, I love it.

855
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:00,536
Get in.

856
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:12,615
Queenie!

857
01:14:18,038 --> 01:14:19,208
Where you going?

858
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:21,457
I...

859
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,785
I'm sick, Mr. Abernathy.

860
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:27,051
Again?

861
01:14:29,049 --> 01:14:30,219
Whatcha got there?

862
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:32,761
Ladies' things.

863
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,469
You wanna take a look? I don't mind.

864
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:37,873
Good gravy. No. I...

865
01:14:38,597 --> 01:14:39,597
I...

866
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:41,771
You get well now.

867
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:44,016
Thanks.

868
01:14:58,078 --> 01:14:59,868
Credence, have you found the child?

869
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:03,287
I can't.

870
01:15:04,376 --> 01:15:05,746
Show me.

871
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:18,181
My boy, the sooner we find this child,

872
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:21,598
the sooner you can put that pain
in the past where it belongs.

873
01:15:23,854 --> 01:15:25,814
I want you to have this, Credence.

874
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:30,070
I would trust very few with it.

875
01:15:32,404 --> 01:15:33,744
Very few.

876
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,120
But you...

877
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:42,001
You're different.

878
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:45,291
And when you find the child,
you touch this symbol,

879
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:47,499
and I will know and I will come to you.

880
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:53,300
Do this, and you will be honored,

881
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:57,041
among wizards forever.

882
01:16:00,057 --> 01:16:01,977
The child is dying, Credence.

883
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:07,462
Time is running out.

884
01:16:20,285 --> 01:16:22,435
Your grandfather kept pigeons?

885
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:24,044
Mine bred owls.

886
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:27,326
I used to love feeding them.

887
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:31,416
Graves always insisted
the disturbances were caused by a beast.

888
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:33,065
We need to catch all your creatures

889
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:35,221
so he can't
keep using them as a scapegoat.

890
01:16:35,384 --> 01:16:37,164
There's only one still missing.

891
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:38,847
Dougal, my Demiguise.

892
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:40,764
Dougal?

893
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:43,029
Slight problem is that...

894
01:16:43,654 --> 01:16:44,872
he's invisible.

895
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:49,046
Invisible?
Yes.

896
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,090
Most of the time. He does...

897
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:57,360
How do you catch something...
With immense difficulty.

898
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:08,791
Gnarlak.

899
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:10,044
Excuse me?

900
01:17:10,269 --> 01:17:11,103
Gnarlak.

901
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:13,846
He was an informant of mine
when I was an Auror.

902
01:17:14,756 --> 01:17:17,626
He used to trade
in magical creatures on the side.

903
01:17:18,552 --> 01:17:21,122
He wouldn't happen to have an interest
in paw prints, would he?

904
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:25,980
He's interested in anything he can sell.

905
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:23,051
How's a guy get a drink in this joint?

906
01:18:25,227 --> 01:18:26,927
What? Ain't you ever seen
a house-elf before?

907
01:18:28,088 --> 01:18:29,869
No. No, of course I have...

908
01:18:30,594 --> 01:18:31,802
I love house-elves.

909
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:33,769
My uncle is a house-elf.

910
01:18:35,278 --> 01:18:36,328
Yeah.

911
01:18:39,674 --> 01:18:42,434
Six shots of Gigglewater
and a Lobe-Blaster, please.

912
01:18:50,268 --> 01:18:51,978
Are all No-Majs like you?

913
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:53,584
No.

914
01:18:54,009 --> 01:18:55,571
I'm the only one like me.

915
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:16,549
I've arrested half of the people in here.

916
01:19:17,254 --> 01:19:19,071
You can tell me to mind my business but,

917
01:19:19,072 --> 01:19:20,218
I saw something,

918
01:19:20,543 --> 01:19:22,376
in that death potion back there.

919
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:26,881
I saw you hugging that Second Salem boy.

920
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:29,249
His name's Credence.

921
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:32,312
His mother beats him.

922
01:19:35,147 --> 01:19:36,897
She beats all those kids she's adopted,

923
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,828
but she seems to hate him the most.

924
01:19:41,027 --> 01:19:42,857
She was the No-Maj you attacked?

925
01:19:44,573 --> 01:19:46,243
That's how I lost my job.

926
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:50,304
I went for her in front of a meeting
of her crazy followers.

927
01:19:51,413 --> 01:19:53,043
They all had to be Obliviated.

928
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:54,366
It was a big scandal.

929
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,083
It's him.

930
01:20:04,384 --> 01:20:05,394
So...

931
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:11,025
You're the guy with the case full of monsters?

932
01:20:11,892 --> 01:20:13,252
News travels fast.

933
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:18,975
I was hoping you'd be able to tell me
if there've been any sightings.

934
01:20:20,108 --> 01:20:21,608
Tracks, that sort of thing.

935
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:26,927
You got a pretty big price
on your head, Mr. Scamander.

936
01:20:28,116 --> 01:20:29,576
Why should I help you...

937
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:32,040
instead of turning you in?

938
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,410
I take it I'll have to make it
worth your while.

939
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:37,939
Let's consider it a cover charge.

940
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:46,334
MACUSA's offering more than that.

941
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:51,096
Lunascope?

942
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:55,344
I got five.

943
01:21:02,692 --> 01:21:04,322
Frozen Ashwinder egg.

944
01:21:04,569 --> 01:21:05,989
Oh, you see, now we're...

945
01:21:07,656 --> 01:21:08,696
Wait a minute.

946
01:21:11,217 --> 01:21:12,387
That's a Bow...

947
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:13,947
That's a Bowtruckle.

948
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,190
Right?

949
01:21:16,456 --> 01:21:17,866
No.
Oh, come on.

950
01:21:18,032 --> 01:21:19,742
They pick locks, am I right?

951
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:21,343
You're not having him.

952
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:23,921
Well...

953
01:21:25,632 --> 01:21:28,342
Good luck getting back alive,
Mr. Scamander,

954
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:30,500
what with the whole of MACUSA
on your back.

955
01:21:32,847 --> 01:21:34,097
All right.

956
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:44,066
Pickett.

957
01:21:56,663 --> 01:22:00,173
Something invisible's been
wreaking havoc around 5th Avenue.

958
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:03,039
You may want to check out
Macy's Department Store.

959
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:04,803
Might have what you're looking for.

960
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:06,053
Dougal.

961
01:22:06,214 --> 01:22:07,514
One last thing.

962
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:11,046
There's a Mr. Graves who works at MACUSA.

963
01:22:11,886 --> 01:22:13,966
I was wondering what you knew
of his background.

964
01:22:14,139 --> 01:22:18,279
You ask a lot of questions, Mr. Scamander.

965
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:21,354
That can get you killed.

966
01:22:25,066 --> 01:22:26,316
MACUSA are coming.

967
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:27,861
You tipped them off?

968
01:22:36,286 --> 01:22:37,406
Sorry, Mr. Gnarlak.

969
01:22:40,749 --> 01:22:42,209
He reminds me of my foreman.

970
01:23:14,491 --> 01:23:15,701
Whatcha doing, Credence?

971
01:23:23,591 --> 01:23:24,721
Where'd you get this?

972
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:26,131
Give it back, Credence.

973
01:23:26,494 --> 01:23:27,954
It's just a toy.

974
01:23:32,759 --> 01:23:34,259
What is this?

975
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:39,926
Take it off.

976
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:07,205
Ma...
I am not your ma.

977
01:24:09,796 --> 01:24:11,156
Your mother,

978
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:12,878
was a wicked,

979
01:24:13,103 --> 01:24:14,995
unnatural woman.

980
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:17,759
It was mine.

981
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:20,522
Modesty.

982
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:34,816
What is this?

983
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:29,802
Demiguise are fundamentally peaceful,

984
01:25:30,168 --> 01:25:32,838
but they can give a nasty nip if provoked.

985
01:25:34,714 --> 01:25:35,844
You two,

986
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:37,452
head that way.

987
01:25:37,926 --> 01:25:40,216
And try very hard not to be predictable.

988
01:25:45,558 --> 01:25:46,948
Was that the Demiguise?

989
01:25:47,172 --> 01:25:48,172
No.

990
01:25:48,219 --> 01:25:50,909
But I think it might be the reason
that the Demiguise is here.

991
01:26:05,954 --> 01:26:08,084
Its sight operates on probability,

992
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:11,424
so it can foresee
the most likely immediate future.

993
01:26:13,503 --> 01:26:14,963
What's it doing?

994
01:26:16,506 --> 01:26:17,836
He's babysitting.

995
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:20,715
What did you just say?

996
01:26:20,885 --> 01:26:21,925
This is my fault.

997
01:26:24,055 --> 01:26:25,695
I thought I had them all,

998
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:27,949
but I must have miscounted.

999
01:26:32,647 --> 01:26:34,037
It was babysitting that?

1000
01:26:47,287 --> 01:26:49,867
Occamies are choranaptyxic.

1001
01:26:50,957 --> 01:26:53,497
So they grow to fill available space.

1002
01:26:58,131 --> 01:26:59,421
Mummy's here.

1003
01:27:20,528 --> 01:27:22,328
We need an insect!

1004
01:27:23,323 --> 01:27:25,583
Any kind of insect and a teapot.

1005
01:27:27,118 --> 01:27:28,378
Find a teapot!

1006
01:27:50,816 --> 01:27:51,716
No!

1007
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:53,225
I got it! I'll get it!

1008
01:27:56,856 --> 01:27:57,856
Teapot!

1009
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:13,712
Roach in teapot.

1010
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:10,258
Choranaptyxic.

1011
01:29:11,806 --> 01:29:14,066
They also shrink to fit the available space.

1012
01:29:19,856 --> 01:29:21,146
Tell me the truth.

1013
01:29:22,984 --> 01:29:25,034
Was that everything
that came out of the case?

1014
01:29:25,778 --> 01:29:27,278
That's everything.

1015
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:30,161
And that's the truth.

1016
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,330
Here she comes.

1017
01:29:36,456 --> 01:29:38,326
You happy to be home? Yeah.

1018
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:40,039
Bet you're exhausted, buddy. Come on.

1019
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:41,459
Just place him in the middle there.

1020
01:29:41,794 --> 01:29:43,764
There you go. That's right.

1021
01:30:10,114 --> 01:30:11,284
Right.

1022
01:30:11,824 --> 01:30:13,334
I think we need to talk.

1023
01:30:18,414 --> 01:30:20,174
I wouldn't have let him keep you, Pickett.

1024
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:22,787
Think I would rather chop off my hand
than get rid of you

1025
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,340
after everything that you've done for me.
Now, come on.

1026
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:29,586
Think we've talked about
the sulking before, haven't we?

1027
01:30:30,676 --> 01:30:31,676
Pickett?

1028
01:30:34,097 --> 01:30:35,347
Come on, give me a smile.

1029
01:30:35,765 --> 01:30:37,265
Pickett, give me a...

1030
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,060
All right.

1031
01:30:40,812 --> 01:30:42,192
Now that is beneath you.

1032
01:30:50,071 --> 01:30:51,241
Hey, Newt.

1033
01:30:53,407 --> 01:30:54,737
Who is she?

1034
01:30:55,576 --> 01:30:56,786
Oh, that's no one.

1035
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,540
Leta Lestrange.

1036
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,538
I've heard of that family.

1037
01:31:04,961 --> 01:31:07,631
Aren't they kind of, you know...

1038
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:09,715
Please don't read my mind.

1039
01:31:21,185 --> 01:31:22,845
Sorry, I asked you not to.

1040
01:31:23,813 --> 01:31:25,483
I know. I'm sorry.

1041
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:27,859
I can't help it.

1042
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:31,072
People are easiest to read
when they're hurting.

1043
01:31:31,237 --> 01:31:32,357
I'm not hurting.

1044
01:31:34,157 --> 01:31:35,947
Anyway, it was a long time ago.

1045
01:31:45,042 --> 01:31:47,672
That was a real close friendship
you had at school.

1046
01:31:50,339 --> 01:31:52,629
Neither of us really fitted in at school.

1047
01:31:54,468 --> 01:31:56,598
So, we became quite...
You became real close?

1048
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:00,100
For years.

1049
01:32:04,395 --> 01:32:05,765
She was a taker.

1050
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:09,280
You need a giver.

1051
01:32:10,193 --> 01:32:11,943
What are you two talking about?

1052
01:32:13,129 --> 01:32:14,129
Nothing.

1053
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:15,817
School.

1054
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:17,620
School.
Did...

1055
01:32:18,451 --> 01:32:19,691
Did you say school?

1056
01:32:20,745 --> 01:32:21,945
Is there a school?

1057
01:32:22,121 --> 01:32:24,156
A wizardry school here in...

1058
01:32:24,681 --> 01:32:25,625
America?

1059
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,713
Of course. Ilvermorny.

1060
01:32:27,877 --> 01:32:30,457
It's only the best wizard school
in the whole world.

1061
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:34,300
I think you'll find that the best
wizarding school in the world is Hogwarts.

1062
01:32:35,134 --> 01:32:36,184
Hogwash.

1063
01:32:46,646 --> 01:32:47,646
Danger.

1064
01:32:50,858 --> 01:32:52,648
He senses danger.

1065
01:33:32,483 --> 01:33:34,993
The Obscurial was here.

1066
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:36,534
Where did she go?

1067
01:33:39,407 --> 01:33:40,697
Help me.

1068
01:33:42,118 --> 01:33:43,408
Help me.

1069
01:33:46,038 --> 01:33:48,288
Didn't you tell me you had another sister?

1070
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:51,709
Please, help me.

1071
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:54,510
Where's your other sister, Credence?
I need help.

1072
01:33:54,672 --> 01:33:56,552
The little one. Where did she go?

1073
01:33:56,716 --> 01:33:58,676
Please, just help me.

1074
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:03,716
Your sister's in grave danger.

1075
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:06,601
We need to find her.

1076
01:34:15,985 --> 01:34:17,445
What is this place?

1077
01:34:17,778 --> 01:34:19,948
Ma adopted Modesty out of here.

1078
01:34:20,114 --> 01:34:21,744
From a family of 12.

1079
01:34:22,575 --> 01:34:25,785
She misses her brothers and sisters.
She still talks about them.

1080
01:34:28,247 --> 01:34:29,747
Where is she?

1081
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:32,752
I don't know.

1082
01:34:34,503 --> 01:34:35,883
You're a Squib, Credence.

1083
01:34:37,131 --> 01:34:39,681
I could smell it off you the minute I met you.

1084
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:41,926
What?

1085
01:34:43,596 --> 01:34:45,846
You have magical ancestry but no power.

1086
01:34:46,974 --> 01:34:48,434
But you said you could teach me.

1087
01:34:48,601 --> 01:34:49,851
You're unteachable.

1088
01:34:50,519 --> 01:34:51,519
Your mother's dead.

1089
01:34:52,313 --> 01:34:53,613
That's your reward.

1090
01:34:54,982 --> 01:34:56,442
I'm done with you.

1091
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:06,582
Modesty?

1092
01:35:18,547 --> 01:35:20,007
Modesty.

1093
01:35:21,217 --> 01:35:25,297
There's no need to be afraid.

1094
01:35:27,098 --> 01:35:29,348
I'm here with your brother, Credence.

1095
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,020
Out you come now.

1096
01:36:11,308 --> 01:36:12,348
Credence.

1097
01:36:13,727 --> 01:36:15,937
I owe you an apology.

1098
01:36:16,856 --> 01:36:18,566
I trusted you.

1099
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:23,237
I thought you were my friend.

1100
01:36:23,988 --> 01:36:25,528
I thought you were different.

1101
01:36:27,867 --> 01:36:29,367
You can control it.

1102
01:36:30,453 --> 01:36:31,623
Credence.

1103
01:36:36,959 --> 01:36:39,339
I don't think I want to, Mr. Graves.

1104
01:37:04,904 --> 01:37:07,284
Is that it?
That's the Obscurial thing?

1105
01:37:09,325 --> 01:37:11,785
That's more powerful
than any Obscurial I've ever heard of.

1106
01:37:16,081 --> 01:37:17,481
If I don't come back,

1107
01:37:18,042 --> 01:37:19,502
look after my creatures.

1108
01:37:20,461 --> 01:37:23,461
Everything that you need to know
is in there.

1109
01:37:24,632 --> 01:37:25,632
What?

1110
01:37:26,008 --> 01:37:27,798
They're not killing it.

1111
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:31,471
Newt!

1112
01:37:32,389 --> 01:37:34,309
You heard him. Look after them.

1113
01:37:36,268 --> 01:37:37,598
Keep hold of that, honey.

1114
01:37:37,978 --> 01:37:39,028
No, no, no, no.

1115
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:42,780
I can't take you.

1116
01:37:43,901 --> 01:37:45,381
Please, let go of me, Jacob.

1117
01:37:47,112 --> 01:37:49,082
You're the one that said I was one of yous.

1118
01:37:49,573 --> 01:37:50,623
Right?

1119
01:37:50,783 --> 01:37:52,623
It's too dangerous.

1120
01:38:22,731 --> 01:38:24,651
To survive so long

1121
01:38:25,985 --> 01:38:28,315
with this inside you, Credence,

1122
01:38:29,697 --> 01:38:30,917
is a miracle.

1123
01:38:31,407 --> 01:38:33,657
You are a miracle.

1124
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:36,169
Come with me.

1125
01:38:37,162 --> 01:38:39,672
Think of what we could achieve together.

1126
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:55,179
Newt!

1127
01:38:55,556 --> 01:38:57,506
It's the Second Salem boy.
He's the Obscurial.

1128
01:38:57,766 --> 01:38:59,136
He's not a child.

1129
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:01,757
His. His power must be so strong,

1130
01:39:01,782 --> 01:39:03,712
he's somehow managed to survive.

1131
01:39:08,152 --> 01:39:09,152
Newt.

1132
01:39:10,571 --> 01:39:11,641
Save him.

1133
01:39:19,204 --> 01:39:20,264
Mr. Graves.

1134
01:39:33,385 --> 01:39:35,745
Tina, you're always turning up
where you're least wanted.

1135
01:39:48,484 --> 01:39:49,994
Contain this.

1136
01:39:50,527 --> 01:39:53,107
Or we are exposed, and it'll mean war.

1137
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:04,957
Credence.

1138
01:40:05,668 --> 01:40:07,028
Credence, I can help.

1139
01:41:46,685 --> 01:41:47,945
Bar the area.
Yes, sir.

1140
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:49,360
I don't want anyone else down there.

1141
01:42:02,242 --> 01:42:03,412
Credence...

1142
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:08,121
It is Credence, isn't it?

1143
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:13,550
I'm here to help you, Credence.

1144
01:42:14,546 --> 01:42:16,796
I'm not here to hurt you.

1145
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:39,071
I've met someone just like you, Credence.

1146
01:42:42,407 --> 01:42:43,657
A girl.

1147
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:46,160
A young girl

1148
01:42:46,578 --> 01:42:48,158
who'd been imprisoned.

1149
01:42:49,873 --> 01:42:54,093
She had been locked away,
and she'd been punished for her magic.

1150
01:43:12,229 --> 01:43:13,439
Credence.

1151
01:43:16,775 --> 01:43:18,145
Can I come over to you?

1152
01:43:21,822 --> 01:43:23,242
Can I come over?

1153
01:43:52,853 --> 01:43:54,643
That thing killed my son.

1154
01:43:55,147 --> 01:43:56,717
I want justice.

1155
01:43:57,649 --> 01:44:01,599
I'll expose you
for who you are and what you've done.

1156
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:26,670
Look! Take photos.

1157
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:56,120
Credence...

1158
01:45:35,414 --> 01:45:36,874
Credence, no!

1159
01:45:42,504 --> 01:45:44,094
Don't do this.

1160
01:45:45,007 --> 01:45:46,087
Please.

1161
01:45:47,426 --> 01:45:49,006
Keep talking, Tina.

1162
01:45:50,637 --> 01:45:52,717
Keep talking to him. He'll listen to you.

1163
01:45:53,223 --> 01:45:54,473
He's listening.

1164
01:45:57,352 --> 01:45:59,562
I know what that woman did to you.

1165
01:46:03,984 --> 01:46:06,154
I know that you've suffered.

1166
01:46:08,488 --> 01:46:10,328
You need to stop this now.

1167
01:46:12,993 --> 01:46:15,373
Newt and I will protect you.

1168
01:46:17,956 --> 01:46:19,116
This man,

1169
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:21,625
he's using you.

1170
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,460
Don't listen to her, Credence.

1171
01:46:24,504 --> 01:46:26,174
I want you to be free.

1172
01:46:27,632 --> 01:46:28,682
It's all right.

1173
01:46:30,343 --> 01:46:31,643
That's it.

1174
01:46:41,605 --> 01:46:42,645
Don't!

1175
01:46:42,814 --> 01:46:43,824
You'll frighten him!
Wands down!

1176
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:46,530
Anyone harms him, they answer to me.

1177
01:46:46,943 --> 01:46:48,953
Credence.
Credence.

1178
01:46:51,073 --> 01:46:52,073
No!

1179
01:46:52,365 --> 01:46:53,525
No!

1180
01:47:28,026 --> 01:47:29,236
Credence.

1181
01:47:30,612 --> 01:47:32,032
You fools.

1182
01:47:34,032 --> 01:47:35,872
Do you realize what you've done?

1183
01:47:36,618 --> 01:47:39,578
The Obscurial was killed
on my orders, Mr. Graves.

1184
01:47:39,946 --> 01:47:40,946
Yes.

1185
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:44,130
And history will surely note that,
Madam President.

1186
01:47:45,502 --> 01:47:47,092
What was done here tonight was not right.

1187
01:47:47,254 --> 01:47:49,924
He was responsible
for the death of a No-Maj.

1188
01:47:50,382 --> 01:47:52,052
He risked the exposure of our community.

1189
01:47:52,217 --> 01:47:54,087
He has broken one of our most sacred laws.

1190
01:47:54,152 --> 01:47:57,782
A law that has us scuttling
like rats in the gutter.

1191
01:47:58,056 --> 01:48:00,456
A law that demands that
we conceal our true nature.

1192
01:48:00,625 --> 01:48:05,488
A law that directs those under its dominion
to cower in fear, lest we risk discovery.

1193
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:10,280
I ask you, Madam President,

1194
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:13,570
I ask all of you...

1195
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:17,620
Who does this law protect?

1196
01:48:19,911 --> 01:48:21,001
Us?

1197
01:48:23,248 --> 01:48:24,618
Or them?

1198
01:48:31,715 --> 01:48:33,755
I refuse to bow down any longer.

1199
01:48:33,925 --> 01:48:35,005
Aurors,

1200
01:48:35,844 --> 01:48:38,354
I'd like you to relieve Mr. Graves of his wand

1201
01:48:38,513 --> 01:48:39,893
and escort him back...

1202
01:49:13,673 --> 01:49:15,053
Accio!

1203
01:49:24,517 --> 01:49:25,727
Revelio.

1204
01:49:50,752 --> 01:49:53,142
Do you think you can hold me?

1205
01:49:55,173 --> 01:49:58,343
We'll do our best, Mr. Grindelwald.

1206
01:50:16,361 --> 01:50:18,821
Will we die just a little?

1207
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:31,458
Hey.

1208
01:50:32,752 --> 01:50:35,782
I figured somebody ought to
keep an eye on this thing.

1209
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:44,090
Thank you.
We owe you an apology, Mr. Scamander,

1210
01:50:45,307 --> 01:50:47,627
but the magical community is exposed.

1211
01:50:48,643 --> 01:50:51,233
We cannot Obliviate an entire city.

1212
01:50:56,526 --> 01:50:57,776
Actually,

1213
01:50:59,321 --> 01:51:00,741
I think we can.

1214
01:51:26,723 --> 01:51:29,563
I was intending to wait
until we got to Arizona.

1215
01:51:32,896 --> 01:51:35,686
But it seems that now
you're our only hope, Frank.

1216
01:51:54,876 --> 01:51:56,456
I'll miss you, too.

1217
01:52:08,932 --> 01:52:10,392
You know what you gotta do.

1218
01:54:38,248 --> 01:54:39,788
They won't remember anything.

1219
01:54:40,959 --> 01:54:44,339
That venom has incredibly powerful
Obliviative properties.

1220
01:54:46,881 --> 01:54:49,031
We owe you a great debt, Mr. Scamander.

1221
01:54:52,262 --> 01:54:53,292
Now,

1222
01:54:53,555 --> 01:54:55,675
get that case out of New York.

1223
01:54:56,391 --> 01:54:57,811
Yes, Madam President.

1224
01:55:04,315 --> 01:55:05,975
Is that No-Maj still here?

1225
01:55:11,155 --> 01:55:12,485
Obliviate him.

1226
01:55:12,657 --> 01:55:14,117
There can be no exceptions.

1227
01:55:16,494 --> 01:55:18,914
I'm sorry, but even one witness...

1228
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:20,160
You know the law.

1229
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:26,340
I'll let you say goodbye.

1230
01:55:37,515 --> 01:55:38,515
Hey.

1231
01:55:41,311 --> 01:55:42,611
This is for the best.

1232
01:55:43,646 --> 01:55:45,416
Yeah. I was...

1233
01:55:46,774 --> 01:55:48,824
I was never even supposed to be here.

1234
01:55:49,777 --> 01:55:51,567
I was never supposed to know...

1235
01:55:53,531 --> 01:55:54,871
any of this.

1236
01:55:59,537 --> 01:56:01,907
Everybody knows Newt only
kept me around because...

1237
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:04,833
Hey,

1238
01:56:05,251 --> 01:56:08,051
Newt, why did you keep me around?

1239
01:56:09,631 --> 01:56:11,051
Because I like you.

1240
01:56:13,468 --> 01:56:15,348
Because you're my friend.

1241
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:19,099
And I'll never forget
how you helped me, Jacob.

1242
01:56:22,435 --> 01:56:23,435
Hey...

1243
01:56:23,895 --> 01:56:25,095
I'll come with you.

1244
01:56:26,731 --> 01:56:28,901
We'll go somewhere. We'll go anywhere.

1245
01:56:30,234 --> 01:56:31,444
See,

1246
01:56:31,694 --> 01:56:34,494
I ain't never gonna find anyone like you.

1247
01:56:37,408 --> 01:56:38,578
There's loads like me.

1248
01:56:39,043 --> 01:56:40,043
No.

1249
01:56:40,703 --> 01:56:41,703
No.

1250
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:44,871
There's only one like you.

1251
01:56:51,089 --> 01:56:52,589
I gotta go.

1252
01:56:57,470 --> 01:56:58,550
Jacob...

1253
01:56:59,472 --> 01:57:01,102
It's okay. It's okay.

1254
01:57:04,102 --> 01:57:05,282
It's okay.

1255
01:57:10,024 --> 01:57:11,834
It's just like waking up, right?

1256
01:59:15,316 --> 01:59:16,566
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

1257
01:59:19,028 --> 01:59:20,108
Hey!

1258
01:59:34,252 --> 01:59:35,502
Dear Mr. Kowalski.

1259
01:59:35,878 --> 01:59:38,338
You are wasted in a canning factory.

1260
01:59:41,592 --> 01:59:44,972
Please take these Occamy eggshells
as collateral for your bakery.

1261
01:59:45,137 --> 01:59:46,597
A well-wisher.

1262
02:00:08,286 --> 02:00:09,406
Well...

1263
02:00:10,288 --> 02:00:11,378
It's been...

1264
02:00:11,503 --> 02:00:12,692
Hasn't it?

1265
02:00:16,794 --> 02:00:18,054
Listen, Newt...

1266
02:00:19,505 --> 02:00:21,045
I wanted to thank you.

1267
02:00:21,632 --> 02:00:23,012
What on earth for?

1268
02:00:24,051 --> 02:00:25,301
Well, you know...

1269
02:00:26,262 --> 02:00:28,980
If you hadn't said all those nice
things to Madam Picquery about me,

1270
02:00:28,981 --> 02:00:31,211
I wouldn't be back
on the investigative team now.

1271
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:35,950
I can't think of anyone
that I'd rather have investigating me.

1272
02:00:39,108 --> 02:00:41,278
Try not to need investigating for a bit.

1273
02:00:41,444 --> 02:00:42,454
I will.

1274
02:00:42,904 --> 02:00:44,884
A quiet life for me from now on.

1275
02:00:45,448 --> 02:00:46,778
Back to the Ministry.

1276
02:00:46,991 --> 02:00:48,411
Deliver my manuscript.

1277
02:00:48,659 --> 02:00:50,159
I'll look out for it.

1278
02:00:50,661 --> 02:00:53,081
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

1279
02:00:59,503 --> 02:01:01,673
Does Leta Lestrange like to read?

1280
02:01:02,924 --> 02:01:04,344
Who?

1281
02:01:05,968 --> 02:01:08,178
The girl whose picture you carry.

1282
02:01:10,681 --> 02:01:13,561
I don't really know
what Leta likes these days.

1283
02:01:14,852 --> 02:01:16,322
'Cause people change.

1284
02:01:17,313 --> 02:01:19,273
Yes.
I've changed.

1285
02:01:20,983 --> 02:01:22,223
I think...

1286
02:01:23,361 --> 02:01:24,781
Maybe a little.

1287
02:01:34,747 --> 02:01:36,867
I'll send you a copy of my book, if I may.

1288
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:39,250
I'd like that.

1289
02:01:57,728 --> 02:02:00,569
I'm so sorry. How would you feel if I...

1290
02:02:00,794 --> 02:02:02,372
I gave you your copy in person?

1291
02:02:05,403 --> 02:02:06,743
I'd like that.

1292
02:02:09,949 --> 02:02:11,579
Very much.

1293
02:03:28,694 --> 02:03:31,614
Where'd you get your ideas
from, Mr. Kowalski?

1294
02:03:31,738 --> 02:03:32,821
I don't know.

1295
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:33,892
I don't know.

1296
02:03:34,909 --> 02:03:36,139
They just come.

1297
02:03:36,952 --> 02:03:38,952
Here you go. Don't forget this.

1298
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:40,330
Enjoy.

1299
02:03:40,831 --> 02:03:42,241
Hey! Hendry.

1300
02:03:42,708 --> 02:03:43,922
Storage, all right?

1301
02:03:44,247 --> 02:03:45,362
Thanks, pal.
