00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:06,190
<i>"Hey, Connie.
How are you today?</i>

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,390
<i>Hope everything's going okay.</i>

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,230
<i>It'd be cool if you told me it was...</i>

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,600
<i>I guess I miss you.</i>

'I guess,' but I mean,</i>

<i>I do miss you...</i>

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,840
Hope you didn't get your phone
mixed up with a tennis ball.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,280
Ha ha."

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,280
A tennis ball?
Really, Universe?

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,280
Help! Ah! Yah!
Back!

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,420
Ugh!

13
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,750
Hey, uh, Stevearoni, ugh,

14
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,160
want to help
your old Pa over here?

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,320
Uh, yeah, Dad, one sec.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,060
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm on it.

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,840
Are you good? Are you safe?
Do you still love me?

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,470
Yeah, of ...
of course, buddy.

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,440
It's just some hoses.
I can buy new ones.

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,240
I still have like
$9 million left,

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,650
and what better way
to spend that

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,450
than on some hoses,
right, kiddo?

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,820
Yeah, Dad.

24
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,650
<i>Steven!</i>

25
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,834
<i>So. Did you ever get around to
watching the "Koala Princess"</i>

26
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:12,930
<i>box set I lent you three months ago?</i>

27
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,330
Hey, is everything okay?

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
You're looking a little glum.

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,630
- I am a little glum.
- Do you want to talk about it?

30
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:28,170
Um, it's just space lag
from when I went to space.

31
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,910
Hmm.

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,990
Ah!

33
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,820
Wait. No.
I need to play it cool.

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,490
I'm just gonna assume by your silence

35
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,730
that you're entangled within

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,830
the immersive koala lore
of the show.

37
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,500
Did you get to the part
where Koala Princess

38
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,960
and Kanga-Roofus kiss?

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Steven, you want to help
us with these groceries?

40
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,970
Coming.

41
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,910
Eh? Eh?

42
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,540
Check this out, Steven.

43
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,880
It's farm fresh.

44
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,480
Uh, thanks guys,
but the fridge is full.

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,190
Not the fridge
at our vacation house.

46
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,890
- Whoo!
- Vacation.

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,060
I thought,
"Why spend money on hoses

48
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,530
when I can spend it
on houses?"

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,900
So I found a place
we could rent

50
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,000
for the weekend
by searching online.

51
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,200
Back in the old days
we just went door-to-door

52
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,370
hoping one was unlocked,

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,100
but this is the new days.

54
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,170
Okay. Well, have fun.

55
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,210
Uh, Steven, you're going
on vacation, too.

56
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,950
Oh, yes. This is the
perfect time for a vacation.

57
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,220
I mean, how often are we
on the same planet together?

58
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,250
Yeah. And you'll be
with your favorite Gems

59
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,790
and your favorite dad.

60
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,560
Agree with Amethyst.

61
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,760
Turn to Steven.

62
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,560
Steven, you should go.

63
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,400
No, with more enthusiasm.

64
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,730
Steven, it's a vacation!

65
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,730
I mean, I would,
but I'm really tied up

66
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,240
with something important.

67
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,270
In the end,
the wombats were for naught,

68
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,910
but it really makes you think.

69
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,040
I'll go.

70
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,580
Aced it.

71
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,820
Here it is, temporary
home sweet temporary home.

72
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,560
- Is that my bed?
- Yeah.

73
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,760
I want you to be
a comfortable as possible,

74
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,730
finally have
some family time.

75
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,430
I feel like you haven't
had that in a while.

76
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,060
Yeah, maybe.

77
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
This place is great.

78
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,100
They have one
of those refrigerators

79
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,600
that dispense water,

80
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,470
not to mention four windows
and an analog clock!

81
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,440
Hmm, says here
we can't use

82
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,840
the water dispenser
or the clock.

83
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,780
Windows must be kept
closed at all times,

84
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,480
and remove all shoes
before entering.

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,150
Hmm.

86
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,130
Hey, Greg, did you invite
anyone else, party guy,

87
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,160
about three feet long,
hissing, reptilian?

88
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,300
No.

89
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,970
Well, you might want
to factor in a plus one.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,100
- Oh! Party guy, no!
- I promise.

91
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,540
It's gonna be
a really good time.

92
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,970
It's a great place, Dad.

93
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,340
It only bit Pearl once,
but, like, we're Gems.

94
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,810
She'll be okay.

95
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,150
It isn't the pain.

96
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,350
It's the surprise.

97
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,320
Hey, Amethyst, do you think
you could...

98
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,560
Yeah.

99
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,690
Hey, Steven.

100
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,060
Hi, Amethyst.

101
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Man, you can see the stars
so clearly out here.

102
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,500
It's pretty, huh?

103
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,740
Huh?
Uh, I don't know.

104
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,900
- It's okay.
- Hey, hey.

105
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,940
It's okay if it isn't okay.

106
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,810
- The sky?
- Yeah.

107
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,010
- What?
- I don't know.

108
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,420
So, uh, you really
into phones now?

109
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,050
No.

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,260
Hey, Schtuball,
won't you take my place?

111
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,300
I've been in here way too long.
I'm gonna become a raisin.

112
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,500
Steven,
you should join me.

113
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,900
Become a raisin.

114
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,910
Okay, but one sec.

115
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,680
Steven, I know
what's troubling you.

116
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,880
You do?

117
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,690
Gosh.
I really messed up, didn't I?

118
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,850
You didn't do
anything wrong.

119
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,860
Pink Diamond
was a villain.

120
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,060
It was 5,750 years ago.

121
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,390
Pink Diamond was
ravishing the planet.

122
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,560
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh.

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,970
Pink Diamond was bad.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,700
Everything bad
had to happen

125
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,140
so good things
could kind of happen.

126
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,740
Uh, good.

127
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,310
You understand.

128
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,710
Buzz.

129
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,750
Buzz.

130
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,250
At least wiggle a little.

131
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,820
Come on. Can't you
give it another shot?

132
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,250
What are we supposed to do?

133
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,650
He just doesn't want
to talk about it.

134
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,260
But I know
it's not space lag.

135
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,960
This is some Gem thing
he knows I won't understand.

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,960
I don't know anything
about Homeworld.

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,800
I don't know anything
about your society.

138
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,270
Whatever horrible things
he saw out there,

139
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,070
you guys have to
put it into context.

140
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,310
If Steven won't
talk to us,

141
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,440
then the help we can
give him is limited.

142
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,740
We've all tried
to coax it out of him

143
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,010
except for...

144
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,410
Me?

145
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,350
But I have no idea
what Homeworld is like now.

146
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,850
Pearl, please.

147
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,520
He knows you know
about space stuff.

148
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,790
It can't hurt to try.

149
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,990
Mm.

150
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,200
Huh. It sure is quiet
out here, huh?

151
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,230
- Yeah.
- So, Homeworld...

152
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,270
I always hoped
you'd see it some day,

153
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,310
but I thought
I'd be there with you.

154
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,180
Being taken there
as a prisoner,

155
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,210
I suppose it was something
of a dramatic experience.

156
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,790
It's just, Steven,

157
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm sure you have
a lot of questions

158
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,330
you'd like answers to,

159
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,560
like about the Diamonds,
for instance.

160
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,600
There are things that are
impossible for me to explain.

161
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
But I want to.

162
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,500
I ...

163
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,340
Steven, I ...

164
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,370
Connie hates me!

165
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,540
What?

166
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,710
We weren't listening.

167
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,350
Also continue, Steven.

168
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,510
I'm not upset about
what happened on Homeworld

169
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,520
although, yeah, a lot of that
was really messed up.

170
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,890
But my relationship with Connie
is even more messed up.

171
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,550
I left her behind
to go to Homeworld

172
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,520
after promising we'd face
everything together.

173
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,530
I'm sure I really hurt her.

174
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,200
I've been calling
and texting her for a week,

175
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,900
but she hasn't
responded once.

176
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,430
Connie might never
talk to me again.

177
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
Steven!

178
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,010
I'll go get him.

179
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,870
I don't know anything
about Homeworld,

180
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,510
but I know about this.

181
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,710
Steven?
Steven?

182
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,050
Steven's not here.

183
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,620
Oh, that's too bad.

184
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,080
So I guess I'll just
talk to this

185
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,720
Steven-shaped barrel
instead.

186
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,090
If you must.

187
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,220
Schtuball, if this was
about Connie,

188
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,730
why didn't you say
anything sooner?

189
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,360
I was embarra...

190
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,230
You were embroidered,
embroiled,

191
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,570
emboldened to talk
to your old man

192
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,970
about your problems?

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,100
I was embarrassed,
okay?

194
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,710
You and the Gems
all liked Connie,

195
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,040
and I was worried that if you
heard what happened

196
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,480
that you'd be
mad at me too.

197
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,250
Oh, Steven, of course
we're not mad.

198
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,550
And I'm sure
Connie's not mad, either.

199
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,650
Well, at least I'm sure
she doesn't hate you.

200
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,420
That whole handing-yourself
over-to-Homeworld thing

201
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,390
was definitely
a high-stress situation.

202
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,830
It really scared
all of us.

203
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,260
I'm not exactly
over it either,

204
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,930
but I guess
carting you off

205
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,470
to the middle of nowhere
to spend time with you

206
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,730
is my way
of dealing with it.

207
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,940
Maybe having some distance
from you is Connie's way.

208
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,140
But the last thing I did was
send her a bunch of dumb texts.

209
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,110
I made some weird joke
about tennis,

210
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,810
and I don't even know
if it makes sense.

211
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,910
- Tennis?
- See?

212
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,610
No wonder she hasn't responded.

213
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,650
Uh, Steven, you don't
get any service out here.

214
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,160
Whaaaat are you even telling me?

215
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,960
Maybe she's been
trying to get in touch

216
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,290
with me this whole time,
and I haven't seen it!

217
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,000
What if she thinks I'm ignoring her?

218
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,860
Dad!
We have to find cell service.

219
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,860
Right.

220
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,900
- Go, go, go!
- Okay.

221
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,810
Floor it!

222
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,440
- How we doing?
- Take a right.

223
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,810
Nah, back up.

224
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,910
No, wait!
Keep going.

225
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,950
- We're heading for a cliff, buddy.
- Just a little further.

226
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,290
- Gonna have to stop soon.
- Almost got it.

227
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,960
Ahh!

228
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,660
Come on. Come on. Come on.

229
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,970
Yes!
We've got service.

230
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,300
<i>Steven! When I didn't
hear back from you,</i>

231
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,640
<i>I was sure a nefarious plot
was afoot...</i>

232
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,140
Well?

233
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,680
No. No messages from Connie.

234
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,520
Aw. You'll get
through this, buddy.

235
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,250
I know it hurts now,
but give it time.

236
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,990
I know.
I need to let it go.

237
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,655
- Got room for three more?
- Always.

238
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,230
- Nice night, isn't it?
- Yeah.
