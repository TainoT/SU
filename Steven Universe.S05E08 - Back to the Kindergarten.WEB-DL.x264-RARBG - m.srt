confirmed for me

180
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:44,233
that once you mess something up,
it's ruined for good

181
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,200
and nothing will ever
be able to grow again.

182
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:50,064
Yeah, we got the subtext.

183
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:53,387
Oh, wow.

184
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:55,575
What about all this?

185
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:58,205
Now that's some plants.

186
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,827
Huh.

187
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:03,049
Guess the countryside out here
is pretty beautiful.

188
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:04,584
But who cares?

189
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:06,721
I wanted to have this
for the kindergarten!

190
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,856
Even if there was nothing we can
do for that one patch of land,

191
00:10:10,103 --> 00:10:13,025
there's still a whole Earth
blooming all around us.

192
00:10:13,783 --> 00:10:14,866
Yeah!

193
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:18,486
Why don't we try gardening
in literally any other place?

194
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:21,400
It'll be easier than trying to
plant in the kindergarten.

195
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:24,403
That dirt doesn't care
how green your thumb is.

196
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:26,634
Green thumb!
'Cause you're green.

197
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:29,237
I know that!

198
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,314
So, are ya in?

199
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:32,661
Um...

200
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:35,182
Do it, do it, do it,
say yes!

201
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,452
Ugh. Fine. I've got literally
nothing else to do.

202
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:41,346
- Oh, yeah!
- Yay!
