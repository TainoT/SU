- Vacation.

I always hoped
you'd see it some day,

I'd be there with you.

Being taken there
as a prisoner,

166

I suppose it was something
of a dramatic experience.

a lot of questions

like about the Diamonds,
for instance.

171

There are things that are
impossible for me to explain.

But I want to.

What?

We weren't listening.

178
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,350
Also continue, Steven.

179
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,510

what happened on Homeworld

180
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,520
although, yeah, a lot of that
was really messed up.

181
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,890
But my relationship with Connie
is even more messed up.

182
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,550
I left her behind
to go to Homeworld

183
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,520
after promising we'd face
everything together.

184
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,530
I'm sure I really hurt her.

185
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,200
I've been calling
and texting her for a week,

186
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,900
but she hasn't
responded once.

187
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,430
Connie might never
talk to me again.

188
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,700
[Crying]

189
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
Steven!

190
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,010
I'll go get him.

191
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,870
I don't know anything
about Homeworld,

192
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,510
but I know about this.

193
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,710
Steven?
Steven?

194
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,050
Steven's not here.

195
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,620
Oh, that's too bad.

196
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,080
So I guess I'll just
talk to this

197
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,720
Steven-shaped barrel
instead.

198
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,090
If you must.

199
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,220
Schtuball, if this was
about Connie,

200
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,730
why didn't you say
anything sooner?

201
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,360
I was embarra...

202
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,230
You were embroidered,
embroiled,

203
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,570
emboldened to talk
to your old man

204
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,970
about your problems?

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,100
I was embarrassed,
okay?

206
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,710
You and the Gems
all liked Connie,

207
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,040
and I was worried that if you
heard what happened

208
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,480
that you'd be
mad at me too.

209
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,250
Oh, Steven, of course
we're not mad.

210
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,550
And I'm sure
Connie's not mad, either.

211
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,650
Well, at least I'm sure
she doesn't hate you.

212
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,420
That whole handing-yourself
over-to-Homeworld thing

213
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,390
was definitely
a high-stress situation.

214
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,830
It really scared
all of us.

215
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,260
I'm not exactly
over it either,

216
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,930
but I guess
carting you off

217
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,470
to the middle of nowhere
to spend time with you

218
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,730
is my way
of dealing with it.

219
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,940
Maybe having some distance
from you is Connie's way.

220
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,140
But the last thing I did was
send her a bunch of dumb texts.

221
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,110
I made some weird joke
about tennis,

222
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,810
and I don't even know
if it makes sense.

223
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,910
- Tennis?
- See?

224
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,610
No wonder she hasn't responded.

225
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,650
Uh, Steven, you don't
get any service out here.

226
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,160
Whaaaat are you even telling me?

227
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,960
Maybe she's been
trying to get in touch

228
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,290
with me this whole time,
and I haven't seen it! [Gasps]

229
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,000
What if she thinks I'm ignoring her?

230
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,860
Dad!
We have to find cell service.

231
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,860
Right.

232
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,900
- Go, go, go!
- Okay.

233
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,810
Floor it!

234
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,440
- How we doing?
- Take a right.

235
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,810
Nah, back up.

236
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,910
No, wait!
Keep going.

237
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,950
- We're heading for a cliff, buddy.
- Just a little further.

238
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,290
- Gonna have to stop soon.
- Almost got it.

239
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,960
Ahh!

240
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,990
[Sighs]

241
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,660
Come on. Come on. Come on.

242
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,970
Yes!
We've got service.

243
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,470
[Gasps]

244
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,300
<i>Ronaldo: Steven! When I didn't
hear back from you,</i>

245
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,640
<i>I was sure a nefarious plot
was afoot...</i>

246
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,140
Well?

247
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,680
No. No messages from Connie.

248
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,520
Aw. You'll get
through this, buddy.

249
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,250
I know it hurts now,
but give it time.

250
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,990
I know.
I need to let it go.

251
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,655
- Got room for three more?
- Always.

252
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,230
- Nice night, isn't it?
- Steven: Yeah.
