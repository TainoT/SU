I'll be right back.

00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,490
I'm just gonna walk Connie out.

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,400
Don't worry! I'm not going
back into space or anything.

13

[Laughs]

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,670
They're never gonna
let me out of their sight again.

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,800
Connie?

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,920
Connie! I know you got to
get home and get some sleep,

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,160
but once you're all rested up,

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,130
I can't wait to tell you
about everything!

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,330
Being on Homeworld was crazy!

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,500
After I turned myself in,
they put me on trial!

21
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,800
And Lars was there.
We got chased by killer robots.

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,340
[Chuckles]
What a wild ride that was.

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,510
And uh...I'm really happy
to see you again.

24
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,180
Umm... a-are you happy
to see me, too?

25
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,480
Of course I'm happy
to see you, Steven.

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,020
Uh, but?

27
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,290
But how could you just
give yourself up like that?

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,060
Well, first,
I said I was my dad,

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,360
and then I said I was my mom.

30
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,830
[Scoffs] No.
I mean, you just gave up.

31
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,330
I had to.

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,130
They were gonna take
all those people.

33
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,630
They were gonna take you!

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,570
But what about our training?

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,870
Stevonnie.
Jam buds.

36
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,540
I believed in us.
We could have done it together.

37
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,080
This is different.
This whole thing was my fault,

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,550
but I knew that I could fix
it all if I turned myself in.

39
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,720
And look ...
No one got hurt.

40
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,850
Well, except for Lars,
but I saved him, too.

41
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,420
But... I'm hurt.

42
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,820
No, you're not.
You're safe.

43
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,230
You're here. I'm here.
We're safe. Everything's fine.

44
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,900
It's not, though.

45
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,740
You know, it was
a tough decision for me to make,

46
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,740
but it had to be done.

47
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,740
- You don't get it.
- Get what?

48
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,840
Let's go, Lion.

49
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,780
[Roars]

50
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,220
"Wow, Steven,
that was so brave of you.

51
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm so glad you're back."

52
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,390
What?!
And Lars is still in space?!

53
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,260
Yeah, he is,
but don't worry,

54
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,760
he's with
some very nice gems

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,300
who are on the run
from their Homeworld overlords.

56
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,970
Oh, Laaaars.

57
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,770
Sadie, he's fine.

58
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,870
We can go see him anytime
through Lion.

59
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,150
Glad he's not ...  At least he's
some kind of alive.

60
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,550
You told his parents, right?

61
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,290
You're kind of
my practice run for that.

00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,490
[Bell dings]

63
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,560
[Sighs]
Let's do this quick.

64
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,730
I can't be away from work
too long.

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,490
I'm basically
their only employee now.

66
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,600
[Shouting, booing]
Whoa, what's going on?

67
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,470
Man: We're sick of it!

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,640
Am I right about it?!

69
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,910
Aliens nearly abducted
the whole town.

70
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,410
And what did Mayor "Billiam"
Dewey do about it?

71
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,850
That is right.
Jack and squat!

72
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,150
[All shouting]

73
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,620
Steven, I'm going to
Lars's parents' house.

74
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,320
Okay, I'll catch up with you.

75
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,520
And that is why
you should vote for me,

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,760
your favorite Nanefua,
for mayor of Beach City!

77
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,430
[All cheering]

78
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,300
When I say "Do we want Dewey?"
you say "No."

79
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,510
- Do we want Dewey?
- All: No!

80
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,180
- Do we want Dewey?
- All: No!

81
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,350
Nanefua: Okay, good job.

82
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,520
Hmm. "Can't hang today.

83
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,520
Mayor D's getting blamed
for Gem stuff,

84
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,790
and it's totally my fault."

85
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,390
I don't know, Universe.
This doesn't look good.

86
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,300
- How's this?
- Oh. That looks great.

87
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,000
But I may need more.

88
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,900
My gosh. I've never had
an opponent before.

89
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,740
Even when I ran for mayor
of high school, I ran unopposed.

90
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,240
Probably because
I made up the position.

91
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,470
If only
I could've warned you

92
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,910
about this abduction stuff
sooner,

93
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,350
then everything
would be fine now.

94
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,310
I really
dropped the ball.

95
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,850
You're right, Universe.

96
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,550
This is all your fault.
Huh.

97
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,850
How about we call
an impromptu town meeting

98
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,020
on the boardwalk?
I'll tell everyone what happened

99
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,820
and how you weren't
involved at all,

100
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,230
and everyone'll
feel better

101
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,060
and vote for you
in the next election.

102
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,730
All right, Universe.

103
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,030
The ball's
back in your court.

104
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,730
Just, uh...
don't drop it again, huh?

105
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,400
So, in conclusion, Mayor Dewey
had nothing whatsoever to do

106
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,940
with the abductions.

107
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,410
Everything was my fault
because I unknowingly provided

108
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,410
some space Gems
with a list of names

109
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,050
and put everyone in danger.

110
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,750
Mayor Dewey
would never do anything

111
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,850
to purposefully endanger
the town.

112
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,450
He basically
just keeps a low profile

113
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,720
and doesn't get involved
in much of anything.

114
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,020
Yeah, maybe
he should be involved!

115
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,390
He's the mayor!

116
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,030
[Crowd booing]

117
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,430
Thanks for listening,
and please vote for him

118
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,560
in the next Beach City
mayoral election.

119
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,270
Oh, ho, ho, yeah!
Hello, everyone.

120
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,035
Thanks for coming. Wow!

121
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:28,970
This whole abduction business
was a real close call, huh? Whoo.

122
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,410
But look around you.
Everyone is safe and accounted for.

123
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,250
That's not true!
What about my friend Lars?

124
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,620
Who?

125
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,790
What?
Lars! Lars Barriga?!

126
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,920
Mr. And Mrs. Barriga's son!

127
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,220
Did you even know
he was still missing?

128
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,790
Did you know he was
still somewhere in space?!

129
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,660
What kind of mayor doesn't
know when his own people

130
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,500
- are lost in space?!
- The donut boy?

131
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,470
Is that why the donut shop
was closed this morning?

132
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,940
- Yeah, but ...
- Do not worry.

133
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,580
I will do everything in my power
to hire a new donut boy.

134
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,810
[Crowd booing]
No!

135
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,420
You've got to be kidding me!

136
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,790
How did this get
on the Internet so fast?

137
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,660
I didn't invite any press to this event.

138
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,760
Someone posted it on Tube-Tube.
Only 12 people have seen it.

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,100
12 people?!
That's half the town!

140
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,670
I'm finished, Universe.

141
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,330
I don't know of many political figures

142
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,470
that have made a comeback

143
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,640
after getting a tomato to the face.

144
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,270
Oh, again, and again,
and again, and again.

145
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,110
You need to stop looping that.

146
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,350
Look, we're gonna
get through this together, okay?

147
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,880
Tomorrow is the big debate.

148
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,950
You still have one more chance
to win back the town's love.

149
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,755
But Steven, some of the
things people have been

150
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:51,520
saying about me are
really painful and mean.

151
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,520
We've just got to change
the conversation.

152
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,130
We can start with this.

153
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,900
"How to talk to people"?

154
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,170
I'm going to get you ready
for that debate,

155
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,240
even if it takes all night.

156
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,370
[Crowd murmuring]

157
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,370
All right.
[Yawns]

158
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,680
Today's the day.

159
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,210
You got your note cards,
you look great,

160
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,380
and if anyone brings up
the alien invasion thing,

161
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,710
I wrote a bunch of Ocean Town
jokes for you to use.

162
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,980
Aww, shucks, Universe.

163
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,420
You're like the son
I never had.

164
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,390
You...have a son.

165
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,890
I know that.

166
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,690
You're just very different
from him, is all.

167
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,660
[Crowd chanting "speech"]

People of Beach City.

175
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,050
You might think
that being a mayor is a fine

176
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,090
and glamorous
sort of thing.

177
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,920
I can understand why my opponent
would want the position.

178
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,930
But I've been mayor of this city
for a decade,

179
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,930
and I know some things
that Ms. Nanefua does not.

180
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,870
You see, when you're the mayor,
you get blamed for everything.

181
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,770
When the boardwalk has termites,
it's the mayor's fault.

182
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,810
When aliens steal people,
it's the mayor's fault.

183
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,940
When the mayor crashes
the mayor mobile

184
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,250
into the only cell tower
in town, it's the mayor's fault.

185
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,150
Most people can't handle that
kind of pressure, but I can.

186
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,120
So, I say to you,
Beach City citizens,

187
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,660
just enjoy our wonderful ocean breeze

188
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,630
and don't worry about a thing.

189
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,460
Just let Dewey "do" it for you!

190
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,430
[Crowd murmuring,
applause]

191
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,640
Nice.

192
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,440
You know, Mayor Dewey,
you are right.

193
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,770
I am?
A-About what?

194
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,310
I have blamed you
for too many things,

195
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,410
and that is not helping.

196
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,320
[Crowd murmuring]

197
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,580
What?

198
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,990
Blaming our problems
completely on the mayor

199
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,290
is not getting us
anywhere.

200
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,460
When one of us suffers,
the town suffers.

201
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,830
When you suffer, Mayor Billiam,
the town suffers.

202
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,800
So, no longer will I
point my fingers at you.

203
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,610
I will extend all my fingers
on both my hands

204
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,840
to everyone here today

205
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,810
and ask that we share
responsibility

206
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,720
for the welfare and safety
of Beach City, together!

207
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,650
Thank you.

208
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,520
[Cheers and applause]

You got this, Mayor Dewey.

[Stammering]

212
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,870
Uh, did you ever notice
how people from Ocean Town ...

213
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,540
Oh, who am I kidding?

214
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,040
Beach City deserves
a real mayor.

215
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,740
Someone wise and collected
like Ms. Nanefua.

216
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,380
[Crowd murmuring]

217
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,910
Wait.
No, no, no.

218
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,550
I withdraw
from the race.

219
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,020
You can find the key to the city
under the city welcome mat.

220

[Sighs]

222
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,060
Mayor Dewey,
what're you doing?!

223
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,230
Y-You can't just
throw the election like that.

224
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,860
W-We could still win!

225
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,870
Well, I know
it's not very traditional

226
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,370
to do that in the middle of
a debate, but why drag it out?

227
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,670
We could have won!
I-I really believed in you!

228
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,080
- I really believed in us!
- Well, you were wrong.

229
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,080
- What do you want me to say?
- How about, "I'm sorry.

230
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,680
We were in this together,
and I let you down."

231
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,120
Come on, Universe.

232
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,950
You know she's gonna be
a better mayor than me.

233
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,060
It was the right thing to do.

234
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:50,390
I guess, but... I still feel betrayed.

235
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,260
That's probably how Connie feels.

236
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,070
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about,

237
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,270
but I've got to find a new job.
