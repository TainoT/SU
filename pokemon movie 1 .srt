1
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,300
August 6th.

2
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,780
Today my colleagues will reach the site

3
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,380
Where an ancient civilization may 
have created a shrine to Mew

4
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,520
The most powerful Pokemon to
have ever existed...

5
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,340
Now believed to be extinct.

6
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,080
Giovanni is financing the expedition.

7
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,980
When he learned of my work 
in the field of cloning,

8
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,450
He agreed to fund my research, 
but only if...

9
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:57,821
I would try to create for him, an
enhanced living replica of Mew.

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,540
I had to agree.

11
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,200
All he wants is to control the most powerful
Pokemon the world has ever known.

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,220
I, of course, want something more...

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,220
Much more.

14
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,520
Mew.

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,260
Our team is bringing back what
we believe to be a Mew fossil.

16
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,200
I pray, it's authentic.

17
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,320
If so, I may finally have the DNA

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,240
I need to create a Pokemon powerful
enough to survive the cloning process.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,840
Perhaps then, I can unlock the
secret to restoring life itself.

20
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
Where am I?

21
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,640
Who am I?

22
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,160
What am I?

23
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,480
It's just like all the other clones, 
doctor. It hasn't gained consciousness.

24
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,560
I just don't understand it. It's
other vital signs are strong.

25
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,880
We're measuring brain activity...

26
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,240
I sense others near me.

27
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,760
What are those strange sounds they make?

28
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,680
Those are words. They're talking.

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
What are you?

30
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,080
What do you mean? I'm a girl.
A person.

31
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,440
A person? Am I a person?

32
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,160
Well, you look like a Pokemon, 
but you talk.

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
I didn't know, a Pokemon could
talk like a person.

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,740
Pokemon? Person? What are those?

35
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,240
Which one am I?

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,840
Maybe it makes a difference to you

37
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,640
If you are a Pokemon or a person,
but not to me.

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,200
If you're in this place, I guess you
must be the same as all of us are

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,560
- What's that?
- I'm not sure.

40
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,000
But Mewtwo and Ambertwo seem to be
communicating with the other clones.

41
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,800
- But how?
- They could be using telepathy.

42
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,080
Soon.

43
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,400
Everybody here is a copy.

44
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,890
That's why there is a "Two" 
after all of our names.

45
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,300
I don't understand.

46
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,730
They call me "Ambertwo",
But I'm still really Amber.

47
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,100
Please, please let my theories be true.

48
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,830
I must see my little girl smile...
Again.

49
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,840
Dear?

50
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,280
I reawakened her consciousness,
here, in this chamber!

51
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,140
I just need to keep it viable long
enough to complete the process!

52
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,800
Why are you doing this?

53
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,620
- You can't bring Amber back.
- You are wrong!

54
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,480
Look, she lives within this light.

55
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,540
Her energy is undeniable.

56
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,740
If my cloning theories are correct, We'll
have Amber back with us one day, soon.

57
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,040
"I loved our daughter, as much
as you did. But she is gone.

58
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,380
No one can bring her back. And
I can't go on watching you try.

59
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,460
I'm sorry. 
Goodbye."

60
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,060
I'll do anything, to see you again.

61
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,020
So, how are they doing today?

62
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,940
You should be very pleased, doctor.

63
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,020
The Pokemon clones are in stable condition,
and the Mewtwo is getting stronger every day.

64
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,100
One of them is bound to survive.

65
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,340
It looks like all our hard
work is finally paying off.

66
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,300
Yes, Giovanni will be very happy, 
I'm sure.

67
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,660
He may soon have the most 
powerful Pokemon in the world.

68
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,100
But I'll get something 
much more precious:

69
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,540
Knowledge, of how to recreate life.

70
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,380
Then, I'll use it to bring her back.

71
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,940
I call this my "Remember Place".

72
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,780
This is where I used to live.

73
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,940
What is that?

74
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,420
That's the sun.

75
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,980
What is it for?

76
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,060
It makes the whole world bright,
And it keeps us warm all day.

77
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,660
- That's called "wind"
- "Wind"?

78
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,060
The wind helps us along.

79
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,980
Sometimes it's soft, and 
sometimes It's very strong.

80
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,780
And that's the sunset.

81
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,860
That's when the sun says:
"Goodnight, see you tomorrow"

82
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,300
Is that a sun?

83
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,300
No, that's the moon.

84
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,580
And the stars are the little
lights that twinkle all night,

85
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,860
Just so we won't
feel alone in the dark.

86
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,580
We're losing all readings 
from Charmandertwo.

87
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,220
No, not again!

88
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,060
Bulbasaurtwo and Squirtletwo
are fading the same way!

89
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,780
It looks like another failure.

90
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,980
Where did they go?

91
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,180
Doctor, we're losing her too.

92
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,140
Amber...

93
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,380
What's wrong, Amber? 
What's happening?

94
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,300
It feels like it's time to say goodbye.

95
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,660
Goodbye?

96
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,860
I feel something.

97
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,740
What are these?

98
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,700
They are tears. You're crying.

99
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,660
- Crying?
- My daddy used to tell me a bedtime story...

100
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,100
...That when Pokemon were sad, and they
cried, their tears were filled with life.

101
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,460
I'm so... Sad.

102
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,540
- I have to go.
- Why?

103
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,700
I don't know.

104
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,500
But it's allright.
Thank you for caring about me.

105
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,660
And don't cry, Mewtwo.

106
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,380
You should be happy. You're alive.

107
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,300
And life is wonderful.

108
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,420
These tears, what good are they?

109
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,940
Please, Amber. 
Come back.

110
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,180
Don't go, please!

111
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,060
Amber!

112
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,460
Doctor, Mewtwo's 
brainwaves are out of control!

113
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,420
It's getting too upset, it mustn't
remember this, administer the serum!

114
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,940
- Do it immediately!
- I'll try a 100 units.

115
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,420
10, 20, 30, 40...

116
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,260
...50, 60, 70, 80...

117
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,980
...90, 100.
- What's happening? Is it working?

118
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,300
It's brainwaves are going back to normal.
Everything seems okay, doctor.

119
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,420
Nothing is okay.

120
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,660
My Amber is gone forever.

121
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,780
Only Mewtwo survives.

122
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,380
I have slept for so long...

123
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,540
... It seems like... Forever.

124
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,020
But I remember something. 
Someone.

125
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,660
"Life is wonderful."

126
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,180
But... Why?

127
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Narrator: Life...

128
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,560
The great miracle and the great mystery.

129
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,040
Who am I?

130
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,560
Who am I?

131
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,560
Who am I?

132
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Since the beginning, humans and Pokemon alike

133
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Have searched for its meaning.

134
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
What am I?

135
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
What am I?

136
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,320
Many strange and wondrous legends evolved

137
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,080
From the pursuit of life's mysteries.

138
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,600
Where am I?

139
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,080
Where am I?

140
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,080
But none is stranger than this tale

141
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,600
Of the most powerful Pokemon of all.

142
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,600
I am ready...

143
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,080
To be.

144
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,120
Where... Am I?

145
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,640
This-- this is not the same.

146
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,120
Was everything before just a dream?

147
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Why?

148
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Female scientist: Doctor, look at this.

149
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Male scientist: What?

150
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,800
Its brain waves, they're surging!

151
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,320
Let's go see! She's right!

152
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,320
Male scientist: Let's run another scan.

153
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Its mind is racing!

154
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Those voices...

155
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Male scientist: I hope we don't lose this one.

156
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
They're outside...

157
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
We can't lose this one.

158
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,840
Where I must be.

159
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,840
Oh!

160
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
[Alarm sounding]

161
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Radio Giovanni's helicopter!
Tell him what's happened!

162
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,840
Male scientist: Quiet!

163
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Let us hear its psychic powers.

164
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,360
Psychic powers?

165
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,360
For years we struggled to
successfully clone a Pokemon

166
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,840
To prove our theories,

167
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,840
But you're the first specimen to survive.

168
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,120
That is Mew, the rarest of all Pokemon.

169
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,840
From its DNA we created you-- Mewtwo.

170
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,360
Mewtwo?

171
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Am I only a copy?

172
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,120
Nothing but Mew's shadow?

173
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,880
You are greater than Mew,

174
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,360
Improved through the power of human ingenuity.

175
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,360
We used the most advanced techniques

176
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,360
To develop your awesome psychic powers.

177
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,640
So, I am simply the end
result of your experiment.

178
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,000
What becomes of me now that

00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Squirt.

366
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
[Groans] I'm starvin'.

367
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,480
I can cook something.

368
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,480
Thanks, but the last time you cooked,

369
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,480
You wiped out 8 of my 9 lives.

370
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
[All sigh]

371
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Pika Pika... Chu!

372
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,480
[Chuckles]

373
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,000
[Squeaks]

374
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
[Squeaks]

375
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Ha ha ha!

376
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,520
[Caws]

377
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,520
Master, shall I extend an invitation

378
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
To these trainers as well?

379
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,000
As you wish.

380
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,040
[Grunts]

381
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
Huh? Huh? Huh?

382
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,040
Ohh! Yeow!

383
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Aah! Aah! Squirt!

384
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,040
Hey, watch where you're flyin'.

385
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Huh? Somethin' for me?

386
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,560
Hmm...

387
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,560
Misty: Wow!

388
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,080
Greetings, Pokemon trainers.

389
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,560
I bear an invitation.

390
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
She's really small, but really pretty.

391
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,560
You have been chosen to join a select group

392
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
Of Pokemon trainers at a special gathering.

393
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,080
It will be hosted by my master,

394
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,560
The world's greatest Pokemon trainer,

395
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
At his palace on new island.

396
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
A chartered ferry

397
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,560
Will leave from old shore wharf

398
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
To take you to the island this afternoon.

399
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,600
Only trainers who present this invitation

400
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Will be admitted.

401
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,600
If you decide to attend, you must reply at once.

402
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
My master awaits you.

403
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Uh, is there a rewind button?

404
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,080
Should we go?

405
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,360
Of course we should!

406
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,600
I've gotta meet her!

407
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,120
I guess the world's number one trainer

408
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Wants to challenge me to a match!

409
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Pika.

410
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,600
Hmm? Well, we've gotta let 'em know right away.

411
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
I'm sayin' yes.

412
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,880
Pika?

413
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,120
Toge.

414
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,120
[Grunts]

415
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
We wanna know what's so special

416
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,120
About the twerp trio's special delivery!

417
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,120
Hey, look!

418
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
"Yes"? To what?

419
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Mew.

420
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,120
[Togepi squeaks]

421
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,360
Pika. Pika. Pi.

422
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,880
Raticate!

423
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,360
Chill out, Raticate!

424
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
Kingler! Save your energy, will ya?

425
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
This is gonna be so cool.

426
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
P.A.: Officer Jenny,

427
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
Please report to the ferry entrance.

428
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
Officer Jenny,

429
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,880
To the ferry entrance, please.

430
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,880
Togepi's totally soaked.

431
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,400
I can't believe how fast the storm came up.

432
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
Aah!

433
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Huh? What?

434
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
The ferry is canceled?

435
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,920
But I've got to get to new island.

436
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Yeah, so do I.

437
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
What's the big deal?

438
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
It's only a little rain.

439
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
It's more than just rain.

440
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,400
The harbor manager

441
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,400
Thinks this could be the worst storm ever.

442
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,920
Listen to me.

443
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,400
The prophets have predicted

444
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,920
The return of the winds of water.

445
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,400
For years, I have prayed

446
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,680
That mankind would never witness

447
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,040
That deadly storm ever again.

448
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,440
Isn't that just a legend?

449
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,920
The ancient writings tell of the storm

450
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Wiping out all but a few Pokemon.

451
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,680
In their sorrow, the water of their tears

452
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,440
Somehow restored the lives lost in the storm.

453
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,440
But there are no Pokemon tears today.

454
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,920
Just waters which no one can survive.

455
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,440
And that's why your ferry

456
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,920
To new island's been canceled.

457
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Well, I'm going to new island anyway.

458
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,960
All my Pokemon are water-type.

459
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:01,960
Not fair.

460
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
We'll just swim over to that palace.

461
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,440
I warn you, the waves will be savage.

462
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
You will never make it.

463
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,960
And besides, if you tried that stunt

464
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,720
And your Pokemon got hurt, you'd be out of luck,

465
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,960
Because we had to close down the Pokemon center.

466
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
Uh, how come?

467
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,480
Because the nurse in charge of the center

468
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,960
Disappeared last month.

469
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,480
And if any of you see her,
please contact me at once.

470
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,960
That's a picture of her over there on the wall.

471
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,160
Mmm. She's cute. Huh.

472
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,360
She sure looks familiar.

473
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Aah! Aah!

474
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,840
[Roars]

475
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
Aah!

476
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,880
Come back here!

477
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,880
Or I'll place you under arrest!

478
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,360
Dewgong-gong.

479
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,880
Come back! Aah!

480
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Some trainers have no fear.

481
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Huh?

482
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,880
To them, this is just one more challenge.

483
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,640
They follow their hearts.

484
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,360
That is what sets them apart

485
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,400
And will make them Pokemon masters.

486
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Good luck to all of you.

487
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
The world's greatest Pokemon master

488
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,880
Is waiting for me.

489
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,400
Let's use our Pokemon to get to that island.

490
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Pika!

491
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,640
Ash, our Pokemon aren't strong enough.

492
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,920
They can't handle giant waves like this.

493
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Guess you're right.

494
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,400
Pika Pika.

495
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
[Scandinavian accent] You vant to cross maybe?

496
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
Ve take you, ja?

497
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Ve vikings are used to big vaves.

498
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,920
Ve get to new island

499
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Faster than you can say fahrvernugen.

500
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Stroke!

501
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
Uhh!

502
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Stroke!

503
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,440
Uhh! Uhh!

504
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,440
Stroke! Stroke!

505
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
Stroke!

506
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,920
Oh, I think I'm gonna have one.

507
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,440
I didn't know vikings still existed.

508
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
They mostly live in Minnesota.

509
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,920
Something's not right.

510
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,960
Are you sure this boat's safe?

511
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,440
Whoa! Pika!

512
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Don't vorry. This ship von't let you down.

513
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,440
Ve alvays sail in da rough veather.

514
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,960
Don't get upset.

515
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,440
Tell my stomach.

516
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,960
Heave. Ho.

517
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Heave. Ho.

518
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,720
Heave. Ho.

519
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,960
Heave. Ho.

520
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
It's all right, Togepi. We're gonna be ok.

521
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Heave. Ho.

522
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
Heave. Ho.

523
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Heave. Ho.

524
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Heave. Ho.

525
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,960
Whoa!

526

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

527
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,960
Pika!

528
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,480
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

529
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,960
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

530
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,000
Those aren't vikings!

531
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
It's Team Rocket.

532
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
I should've known there was
something fishy about them

533
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,720
Besides the way they smell.

534
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,000
Ha! Prepare for trouble.

535
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,480
Make it double.

536
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,000
Meowth: Forget the motto. We're gonna have to--

537
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,480
Aah! Aah! Aah!

538
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Staryu: hyah!

539
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Hyah!

540
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Ash! Misty!

541
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Uhh! Ohh!

542
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,000
Aah! Aah!

543
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,520
Have you seen Ash and Pikachu?

544
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Not yet.

545
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Aah! Aah!

[Gasps]

547
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,040
Stay together. It's our only hope.

548
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,520
Pika!

549
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

550
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
[Grunting]

551
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,560

00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,360
Huh?

743
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,840
Male scientist: I haven't got much time.

744
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,360
[Scientists screaming]

745
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,880
I pray this record of our experiment survives.

746
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,880
A year ago, we discovered
a fossil that proved to be

747
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,360
The remains of the ancient Pokemon, Mew.

748
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,360
Huh? Huh? Huh?

749
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,880
There was sufficient genetic
material to replicate Mew,

750
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,880
But Giovanni, who funded our project,

751
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,120
Insisted we try to design super clones

752
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,360
More powerful than any living Pokemon.

753
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,360
Many attempts failed,

754
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,880
But finally our experiments proved successful.

755
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,400
We produced a living Pokemon.

756
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,880
We called it Mewtwo.

757
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,880
But for some reason,

758
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
The creature's anger is out of control.

759
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,360
With its psychic powers,

760
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,360
It is destroying our laboratory.

761
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,880
We dreamed of creating the
world's strongest Pokemon...

762
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,400
And we succeeded.

763
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,920
Sounds like a real Pokenstein.

764
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,640
Sure does.

765
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,360
One bad cat.

766
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,920
So this must be the lab.

767
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,880
But if Mewtwo destroyed it...

768
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,360
Somebody rebuilt it.

769
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,880
Yes. But who?

770
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,880
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

771
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,600
Mewtwo: You humans are a dangerous species.

772
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,080
You brought me into your world

773
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,080
With no purpose but to be your slave.

774
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,080
But now I have my own purpose.

775
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,640
My storm will create my own world...

776
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,840
By destroying yours.

777
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,080
So you hate all humans,

778
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,120
And you're gonna destroy us

779
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,120
To save Pokemon.

780
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:44,120
No. Your Pokemon will not be spared.

781
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,640
They have disgraced themselves

782
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,600
By serving humans.

783
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,160
Those Pokemon are nothing but slaves.

784
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,120
Pika. Pika Pika.

785
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,600
So...

786
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,120
You say I am wrong?

787
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,680
That you are not this human's servant,

788
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,120
You are his friend?

789
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,160
Pika.

790
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,640
You are as pathetic as the rest.

791
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,680
Pika.

792
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,640
Ash: huh?

793
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,880
Pika!

794
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,120
Uhh!

795
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,120
Aah! Pika-pi.

796
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,120
Pikachu.

797
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,640
Humans and Pokemon

798
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,120
Can never be friends.

799
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,120
Ash...

800
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,640
Are you ok?

801
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,640
Don't pick on Pikachu.

802
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,640
If you are Pokemon,

803
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,160
There's no reason I can't capture you.

804
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,160
Go, Rhyhorn.

805
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,160
[Roars]

806
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,680
Ohh!

807
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,680
No! Rhyhorn!

808
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,160
Mewtwo: Fools.

809
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,160
Your Pokemon attacks cannot weaken me.

810
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,680
My powers are too great.

811
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,680
No trainer can conquer me.

812
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,200
Then you won't mind proving it

813
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,680
In a real match.

814
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,200
Is that a challenge?

815
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,680
You bet it is.

816
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,680
Hmm?

817
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,200
Huh? Huh?

818
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,720
[All gasp]

819
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,720
They're awake.

820
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,240
Blaaast!

821

822
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,720
Saur.

823
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,760
Saur.

824
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,480
[Shuddering]

825
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,240
Hmm? Hmm?

826
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,760
James: I'm scared.

827
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,760
Jessie: Me, too.

828
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,760
Meowth.

829
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,760
Mewtwo: Like most Pokemon trainers,

830
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,280
I, too, began with Charmander,

831
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,280
Squirtle, and Bulbasaur.

832
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,760
But for their evolved forms,

833
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,760
I used their genetic material

834
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,280
To clone even more powerful copies.

835
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,280
Copies.

836
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,760
They're clones.

837
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,520
[All gasp]

Blaaast!

841
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,800
A stadium.

842
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,320
Mewtwo planned this all along.

843
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,800
Your fake Venusaur can't beat my real one!

844
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:04,800
Right, Bruteroot?

845
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,320
Saur.

846
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,320
We'll blow away that Blastoise,

847
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,800
Won't we, Shellshocker?

848
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,320
Blaast!

849
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,320
It may not have a nickname,

850
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,320
But I do have... Charizard.

851
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,320
I choose you!

852
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,840
Charizard, I didn't say start.

Pik.

854
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,840
Your Charizard is poorly trained.

[Growls]

856
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,360
Hmm.

857
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,160
Mewtwo: Which of you will oppose me first?

858
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,680
Saur.

859
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,160
I underestimated you last time,

860
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,160
But that won't happen again.

861
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,680
Go, Bruteroot!

862
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,200
Razor leaf!

863
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,200
Saur.

865
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,680

867
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,200
Saur!

868
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,720
Bruteroot!

869
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,480
It looks like I'm up.

870
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,200
Go, Shellshocker.

871
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,200
Blastoise.

872
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,240
Blaast!

873
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,720
Shellshocker, hydropump!

874
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,720
Blast!

875
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,240
Oy!

876
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,720
Shellshocker!

877
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,240
You better forfeit, Ash.

878
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,240
Those clones are too powerful.

879
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,240
I'm not giving up.

880
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,240
[Roars]

881
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,760
Charizard,

882
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,240
Use your speed, not power,

883
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,240
And you'll win.

884
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,760
[Growls]

885
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,240
All right, go!

886
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,760
[Both growling]

887
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,760
Can't Charizard move any quicker?

888
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,760
The clone is too fast.

889
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,280
Pika.

890
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,280
Charizard's in trouble!

891
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,800
Finish it.

[Roars]

893
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,800
No, Charizard, no!

894
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,800
Are you ok?

895
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,480
Mewtwo: As the victor,

896
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,960
I now claim my prize--

897
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,480
Your Pokemon.

898
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,000
No.

899
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,480
No.

Hey, wait!

901
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,480
[Gasps] ohh!

902
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Huh?

903
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
What are you going to do with those Pokemon?

904
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I will extract their DNA
to make clones for myself.

905
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,480
They will remain safe on this island with me

906
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,000
While my storm destroys the planet.

907
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
You can't do this!

908
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,520
Yeah, Mewtwo, we won't let you!

909
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,520
Do not attempt to defy me.

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,000
This is my world now.

914
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,000
Ohh! Uh-oh.

915
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,520
Let's go!

916
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,040
Whoa!

Aw...

00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,080
Hey, I know.

929
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,080
Mewtwo can't capture them

930
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,560
If they're already inside their Pokeballs.

931
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,560
Bulbasaur, Squirtle, return!

932
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,560

00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,080
Huh?

935
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,600
It is futile to try and escape my power.

936
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,600
Uhh!

937
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,080
Never mind the Pokeballs.

938
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,080
Carry 'em away.

939
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,080
Psy-yi-yi!

940
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,080
Huh?

941
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,600
Give back my Psyduck!

942
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,840
Uhh! Vulpix!

943
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,080
[Panting]

944
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,080
Aah!

945
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,080
Pika!

946
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,600
Uhh! Run, Pikachu!

947
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,360
Pika Pika Pika Pika.

948
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,720

[Panting] Pika Pika Pika Pika

955
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,120
Pika Pika Pika.

956
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,640
Keep running, Pikachu!

957
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,640
Pikachu!

958
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,640
Pika Pikachu!

959
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,120
Pika Pika Pika Pikachu!

960
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,640
Pika Pikachu!

961
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,640
[Panting] Pika Pika Pika Pika.

962
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,160
Uhh! Whoa!

963
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,160
Pikachu!

[Squawks]

965
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,160
Pika.

966
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,160
Pik--

967
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,160
Aah!

968
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,160
Pikachu!

969
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,680
Ehh!

970
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,440
Aah!

971
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,800
Pika!

972
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,200
Whoa!

973
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,680
Hey!

974
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,680
You're not gonna get Pikachu!

975
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,040
There goes...

976
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,520
Alakazam...

977
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,040
Dewgong...

978
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,040
Vileplume!

979
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,560
Meowth: Sandshrew. Nidoqueen. Vaporeon.

980
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,560
But me, I got a special place
in my tail for this one.

981
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,040
[Thud]

982
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,080
[Ash grunts]

983
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080
Huh? Huh?

984
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,560
Ohh...

985
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,560
Eee! Look there!

986
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,080
Uhh.

987
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,080
Aah! I don't have time for your dumb motto today.

988
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,080
Aah! Uhh!

989
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,560
Aah!

990
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,560
Both: Who's that Pokemon?

991
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,560
It's Pikachu!

992
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,320
Ow! Let go!

993
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,080
Stupid machine!

994
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,080
Gimme back my Pikachu!

00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,080

[Alarm sounding]

997
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,080
What's happening?

998
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,600
Ahh. Pbblt-pfft!

999
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,880

1000
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,120

[Squeals]

1003
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,600
I'm so glad you're ok.

1004

[Whimpering]

1005
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,120
The copies are hatching.

1006
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,640
They're fabulous fakes.

1007
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,640
Send in the clones.

1008
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,640
But where are the real ones?

1009
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,640
Pika?

1010
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,640
[Alarm sounding louder and faster]

1011
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,640
I wonder if they feel...

1012
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,640
Clonesome.

1013
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,640
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1014
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,160
[Gasping, whimpering]

1015
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,160
The Poke originals.

1020
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,160
Ha ha ha!

1021
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,920
Squirt.

1022
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,160
Bulba.

1023
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,160
Pika! Pika!

1024
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,200

1025

1026
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,440
Oh, you're all ok!

Bulbasaur: Saur!

1028
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,200
Ha ha ha ha.

1029
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,680
Bulbasaur: Bulbasaur!

1030
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,200
Hmm?

1031
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,880
Humans, you have served my purpose.

1032
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,880
I am sparing your lives, for the moment.

1033

[Doors creak open]

1034
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,400
But you cannot escape your fate.

1035
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,400
The hour of my vengeance draws near.

1036
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,920
Behold.

1037
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,400
Ah. Ohh.

1038
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,920
Mewtwo: With Pokemon and humans eliminated,

1039
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,920
The clones shall inherit the world.

1040
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,920
Ash: You can't do this.

1041
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,920
I won't let you.

1042
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,440
It's Ash. All right.

1043

Psyduck! Vulpix!

1046
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,960
Mewtwo: It is useless to challenge me.

1047
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,960
It's not going to end like this, Mewtwo.

1048
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,200
We won't let it.

1049
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,960
You're mine.

1050
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,200
Aah!

1051
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,840
Uhh!

1052
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,480
Ugh!

1053
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,480
Ash, no! Look out!

1054
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,480

Uhh!

1057
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,480
What?

1058
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,720
Whoa!

1059
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,120
Ohh!

1060
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,560
[Laughs]

1061
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,000
Can it be?

1062
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,480
Whoa!

1063
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Mew!

1064
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
[Laughs]

1065
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
What is that?

1066
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I don't know.

1067
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,520
Mew.

1068
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,520
So, finally, we meet.

1069
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,520
Mew.

1070
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,000
Mew?

1071
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,520
Mew?

1072
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,040
I may have been cloned from your DNA,

1073
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,520
But now I will prove

1074
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,040
That Mewtwo is better than the original--

1075
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,040
Superior to Mew.

1076
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,520
Mew.

1077
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,520
Mew and Mewtwo.

1078
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,040
So Mewtwo was cloned from Mew.

1079
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,520
Pika.

1080
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,520
Saur.

1081
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,520
This world is too small for 2 of us.

1082
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,520
Mew.

1083
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,800
Whoa!

1084
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,040
Ohh.

1085
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,560
Why do you flee from me?

1086
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:09,560
Are you afraid to find out
which of us is greater?

1087
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,080
Mew!

1088
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,560
Heh heh.

1089
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,080
[All gasp]

1090
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,560
Pika.

1091
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,080
Ohh.

1092
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,600
Uhh!

1093
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,600
So, you do have some fight in you,

1094
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,080
But I have no time for games.

1095
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,600
Destiny is at hand.

1096
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,840
Who will rule?

1097
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,600
My super Pokemon

1098
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,120
Or your pathetic group

1099
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,600
Of spineless, inferior Pokemon?

1100
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,600
Mew.

1101
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,120
We were created

1102
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:04,120
With powers far stronger than the originals.

1103
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,120
[Meowing]

1104
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,120
Huh?

1105
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,600
Hmm. Mew's got a good point.

1106
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,640
What's it saying?

1107
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,640
Mew says you don't prove anything

1108
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,640
By showing off a lot of special powers,

1109
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,640
And that a Pokemon's real strength

1110
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,640
Comes from the heart.

1111
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,120
My clones don't need their powers

1112
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,120
To prove their worth.

1113
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,120
Mew!

1114
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,120
Aah! Aah!

1115
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,640
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1116
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,640
Mewtwo: I will block

1117
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,640
All the Pokemon's special abilities

1118
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,640
Using my psychic powers.

1119
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,160
Now we shall see who triumphs.

1120
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,640
Go!

1121
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,160
[Creatures roar]

1122
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,160
Pi.

1123
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,400

Ohh.

1317
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,600
Pika-pi.

1318
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,280
Pi?

1319
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,800
Pika.

1320
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,280
Huh?

1321
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,560
Oh.

1322
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,160
Mmm.

1323
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,480
Pikachu.

1324
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,640

1327
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,040
Squirt.

1328
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,920

[Hisses]

1332
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,320
A human sacrificed himself

1333
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,840
To save the Pokemon.

1334
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,320
I pitted them against each other,

1335
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,320
But not until they set aside their differences

1336
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,840
Did I see the true power

1337
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,360
They all shared deep inside.

1338
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,360
Mew.

1339
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,360
I see now

1340
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,360
That the circumstances of one's birth

1341
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,360
Are irrelevant.

1342
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,360
It is what you do with the gift of life

1343
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,360
That determines who you are.

1344
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,120
Mew.

1345
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,480

1353
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,200
Scyther.

1354
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,280
Blast.

1355
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,600
Ooh! Ooh!

1356
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,880
[Caws]

1360

Pikachu!

1361
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,880
Mewtwo,

1362
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,400
Where are you going?

1363
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,400
Mewtwo: Where my heart can learn

1364
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,880
What yours knows so well.

1365
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:13,400
What transpired here, I will always remember,

1366
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,400
But perhaps, for you,

1367
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,400
These events are best forgotten.

1368
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,920
[All gasp]

1369
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,400
Whoa!

1370
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,920
Aah!

1371
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,440
This could be the worst storm ever.

1372
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,440
You must listen to me.

1373
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,440
You have got to find shelter.

1374
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,440
Joy: Excuse me, please.

1375
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,920
The Pokemon treatment center

1376
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,440
Will be open as a shelter.

1377
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,440
Anyone who needs a place to stay

1378
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,960
Should come with me.

1379
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,680
Boy: You think they'll have a pizza down there?

1380
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,960
Nurse Joy and officer Jenny are really great.

1381
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,440
They just keep getting more beautiful

1382
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,960
Every time I see 'em.

1383
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:11,440
Hey, guys, how did we wind
up in this place anyway?

1384
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,960
Well, I guess we're just here

1385
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,480
Because we're here.

1386
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,960
Pika.

1387
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,720
Yeah. Let's eat.

1388
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,960
Uh-huh. Pika-pi.

1389
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,520
Jenny: Look, it's a miracle.

1390
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,520
Huh? Huh?

1391
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,280
I can't believe it.

1392
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,000
The storm disappeared.

1393
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,000
That's so weird.

1394
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:41,520
It's good to have things clear again.

1395
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,040
Hmm.

1396
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,040
Hey, what's that?

1397
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,040
Brock: hmm?

1398
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,520
What's what?

1399
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,040
I don't see anything, Ash.

1400
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,560
Except the sky.

1401
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,560
Hmm.

1402
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,040
The day I left home

1403
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,040
To start my Pokemon journey,

1404
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,040
I saw a really rare Pokemon,

1405
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,040
And just now,

1406
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,040
I thought I saw another one.

1407
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,040
Well, maybe you're just seeing things, Ash.

1408
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,040
Huh?

1409
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,040
Well, maybe he's not.

1410
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,040
Ha ha!

1411
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,560
Hmm.

1412
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,080
Well, maybe we'll see.

And just as many adventures
await our young heroes

1417
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,560
As they continue on their quest.

1418
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,080
For Ash and his friends,

1419
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,080
The journey's just begun.

1420
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,600
I don't have a clue how we got here,

1421
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,080
But who cares?

1422
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,600
This is paradise.

1423
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,080
For once, a happy ending.
