you don't want to do,

178
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:44,910
like get jettisoned into
space to live forever

179
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:46,445
on a floating rock
with a barn,

180
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,981
and just us for as long
as time exists!

181
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:51,584
Lapis needs us!

182
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:52,985
Peridot, give her a second.

183
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,854
She's doing it to herself!

184
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:57,423
Pumpkin, do as you're told!

185
00:07:57,457 --> 00:07:58,924
Aah!

186
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,959
[Whimpers]

187
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:01,527
Whoa, Peridot.

188
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:04,663
It sounds like you
don't really want to go.

189
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:06,432
I'm sorry, Pumpkin.

190
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,701
I didn't mean
to yank you around.

191
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:11,604
It's just we don't have
a choice in this.

192
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:13,773
What do you mean,
you don't have a choice?

193
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:18,444
Peridot, you should really
talk to Lapis about this.

194
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,015
- I can't.
- What? Why not?

195
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,719
Oh, great.
You found her!

196
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:28,821
Now, let's go.

197
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,792
[Rumbling]
[Music]

198
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,827

200

[Shivers]

201
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,801
Wait... Lapis?

202
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:44,737
Pumpkin doesn't want to go.

203
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:48,774
Pumpkin doesn't know better.
We do.

204
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:53,079
Actually, I...
I don't want to go either.

205
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:54,714
What?!

206
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:55,848
- Aah!
- Aah!

207
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,966
Ooh-whoa!
[Yelps]

208
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:02,154
Peridot, what are you
trying to say?

209
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:05,124
It's just, if something
happens on Earth,

210
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:08,627
- I want to be here for it!
- But ... no!

211
00:09:08,662 --> 00:09:10,696
Why are you telling me this now?!

212
00:09:10,731 --> 00:09:13,899
Because we're about to leave!

213
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:17,203
- Isn't that the worst time?
- Yes.

214
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:18,838
[Chuckles nervously]

215
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:21,574
Then why didn't
you tell me sooner?

216
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:24,276
Well, there are many
things I should say,

217
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:25,878
but they would upset you,

218
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:28,914
so in general,
I don't say those things.

219
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:30,850
Peridot, that's lying!

220
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:32,885
[Groaning]

221
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,988
Okay, then! The truth is...

222
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:39,325
I think that we should stay,
and if ... and if the time comes,

223
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:42,695
if the Diamonds do come to wipe
this planet off the star maps,

224
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,897
I think we should fight
for this life we've built

225
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:46,966
instead of tearing it up
out of the ground!

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,035
I think we can win.

227
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:51,337
I think you can win.

228
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:53,739
Earth is our home now.

229
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:55,808
Isn't it worth fighting for?

230
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:00,680
What do you say, Lapis?

231
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:03,015
[Music]

232
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,154
I am not getting caught in
the middle of another war.

233
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:11,864
[Rumbling]

234
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:17,096
Wait! No!

235
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,798
You're supposed to
reward me

236
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:20,900
for my emotional honesty!

237
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:30,409

238
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:39,251
[Insects chirping]

239
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:42,288
Come on. Let's go.

240
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:48,828
Okay.
You're all set up,

241
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:52,098
and you can stay here
as long as you need.

242
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:56,469
Wow. [Groans]
Thanks.

243
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,379
[Sighs]

244
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:10,282
What do we do now?
