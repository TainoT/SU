to one of my shows.</i>

170
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:41,183
<i>They never even wanted
to hear about them.</i>

171
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:42,017
<i>Really?</i>

172
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:43,352
<i>It's kind of amazing</i>

173
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,020
<i>that your mom
is excited about your band.</i>

174
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,689
<i>It's just
really nice to see.</i>

175
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:48,857
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

176
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:52,728
<i>I-I guess you're right.</i>

177
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,964
<i>Jenny: Are you ready, Sadie Killer?</i>

178
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,233

- Aah!</i>

179
00:06:57,234 --> 00:07:00,001

<i>I love enthusiasm.</i>

183
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,176
<i>And we got about six more
cameras in the back of the van.</i>

184
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,845
<i>What do you mean, you don't
know how to tie a tie?</i>

185
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,714
<i>Yeah. Like, didn't
your dad teach you?</i>

186
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:14,516
<i>He used to wear them
every day.</i>

187
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:17,019
<i>They were clip-ons.</i>

188
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:21,056
<i>Steven: Sadie! What's up?
Are you nervous?</i>

189
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:26,027
<i>No, no. I'm just, um ...
just getting ready.</i>

190
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:28,663

192
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,768
<i>Mom?!</i>

193
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,770
<i>Does she think she can just
show up in some wacky disguise</i>

194
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:38,373
<i>and I won't know it's her?</i>

195
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:39,742
<i>It's so obvious!</i>

196
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:43,212
<i>Maybe she should have gotten
some costume tips from you.</i>
